\title{A class for constructing biodb objects.}
\description{
This class is responsible for the creation of database connectors and
database entries. You must go through the single instance of this class to
create and get connectors, as well as instantiate entries. To get the single
instance of this class, call the \code{getFactory()} method of class
\code{Biodb}.
}
\section{Methods}{

\describe{
\item{\code{connExists(conn.id)}}{:

Tests if a connector exists.
    
conn.id: A connector ID.
    
Returned value: TRUE if a connector with this ID exists, FALSE otherwise.
    }

\item{\code{createConn(db.class, url = NULL, token = NA_character_,
  fail.if.exists = TRUE, conn.id = NULL, cache.id = NULL)}}{:

Creates a connector to a database.
    
db.class: The type of a database. The list of types can be obtained from
    the class BiodbDbsInfo.
    
url: An URL to the database for which to create a connection.  Each
    database connector is configured with a default URL, but some allow you to
    change it.
    
token: A security access token for the database. Some database require
    such a token for all or some of their webservices. Usually you obtain the
    token through your account on the database website.
    
fail.if.exists: If set to TRUE, the method will fail if a connector for
    the requested database already exists.
    
conn.id: If set, this identifier will be used for the new connector. An
    error will be raised in case another connector already exists with this
    identifier.
    
cache.id: If set, this ID will be used as the cache ID for the new
    connector. An error will be raised in case another connector already exists
    with this cache identifier.
    
Returned value: An instance of the requested connector class.
    }

\item{\code{createNewEntry(db.class)}}{:

Creates a new entry from scratch. This entry is not stored in cache.
    
db.class: A database ID.
    
Returned value: A new BiodbEntry object.
    }

\item{\code{deleteAllCacheEntries(conn.id)}}{:

For a connector, deletes all entries stored in the cache.
    
conn.id: A connector ID.
    
Returned values: None.
    }

\item{\code{deleteAllConnectors()}}{:

Deletes all connectors.
    
Returned value: None.
    }

\item{\code{deleteConn(conn)}}{:

Deletes an existing connector.
    
conn.id: A connector instance or a connector ID.
    
Returned value: None.
    }

\item{\code{deleteConnByClass(db.class)}}{:

Deletes all existing connectors from a same class.
    
db.class: The type of a database. All connectors of this database
    type will be deleted.
    
Returned value: None.
    }

\item{\code{getAllCacheEntries(conn.id)}}{:

For a connector, gets all entries stored in the cache.
    
conn.id: A connector ID.
    
Returned values: A list of BiodbEntry objects.
    }

\item{\code{getAllConnectors()}}{:

Gets all connectors.
    
Returned value: A list of all created connectors.
    }

\item{\code{getConn(conn.id)}}{:

Gets a connector instance, creating it if necessary and possible.
    
conn.id: An existing connector ID or a database class (Biodb database ID).
    In case a database ID is submitted, and no connector for this database ID
    already exists, a new connector for this database ID is created.
    
Returned value: The connector instance corresponding to the connector ID
    or to the database ID submitted.
    }

\item{\code{getEntry(conn.id, id, drop = TRUE)}}{:

Retrieves database entry objects from IDs (accession numbers), for the
    specified connector.
    
conn.id: An existing connector ID.
    
id: A character vector containing database entry IDs (accession numbers).
    
drop: If set to TRUE and the list of entries contains only one element,
    then returns this element instead of the list. If set to FALSE, then returns
    always a list.
    
Returned value: A list of BiodbEntry objects, the same length as `id`. A
    NULL value is put into the list for each invalid ID of `id`.
    }

\examples{
# Create a Biodb instance with default settings:
mybiodb <- biodb::Biodb()

# Obtain the factory instance:
factory <- mybiodb$getFactory()

# Create a connection:
conn <- factory$createConn('chebi')

# Get a database entry:
entry <- factory$getEntry('chebi', id='2528')

# Terminate instance.
mybiodb$terminate()
