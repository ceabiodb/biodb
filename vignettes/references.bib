Algorithm theory with its process of subsequent modelling, design, and analysis is not a competing approach to algorithmics but an important ingredient of algorithm engineering.",

	abstract="Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible.",

	abstract = { Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2) is a widely used approach for structural annotation and identification of metabolites in complex biological samples. The importance of assessing the contribution of the precursor ion within an isolation window for MS2 experiments has been previously detailed in proteomics, where precursor ion purity influences the quality and accuracy of matching to mass spectral libraries, but to date, there has been little attention to this data-processing technique in metabolomics. Here, we present msPurity, a vendor-independent R package for liquid chromatography (LC) and direct infusion (DI) MS2 that calculates a simple metric to describe the contribution of the selected precursor. The precursor purity metric is calculated as “intensity of a selected precursor divided by the summed intensity of the isolation window”. The metric is interpolated at the recorded point of MS2 acquisition using bordering full-scan spectra. Isotopic peaks of the selected precursor can be removed, and low abundance peaks that are believed to have limited contribution to the resulting MS2 spectra are removed. Additionally, the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be taken into account. The package was applied to Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA)-based MS2 metabolomics data sets derived from three metabolomics data repositories. For the 10 LC-MS2 DDA data sets with > ±1 Da isolation windows, the median precursor purity score ranged from 0.67 to 0.96 (scale = 0 to +1). The R package was also used to assess precursor purity of theoretical isolation windows from LC-MS data sets of differing sample types. The theoretical isolation windows being the same width used for an anticipated DDA experiment (±0.5 Da). The most complex sample had a median precursor purity score of 0.46 for the 64,498 XCMS determined features, in comparison to the less spectrally complex sample that had a purity score of 0.66 for 5071 XCMS features. It has been previously reported in proteomics that a purity score of <0.5 can produce unreliable spectra matching results. With this assumption, we show that for complex samples there will be a large number of metabolites where traditional DDA approaches will struggle to provide reliable annotations or accurate matches to mass spectral libraries. }

This tutorial shows a step-by-step procedure for anyone interested in designing and building chemical libraries with or without chemoinformatics experience. The aim is to explore various methodologies proposed by synthetic organic chemists and explore affordable chemical space using open-access chemoinformatics tools. As part of the tutorial, we discuss three examples of design: a Diversity-Oriented-Synthesis library based on lactams, a bis-heterocyclic combinatorial library, and a set of target-oriented molecules: isoindolinone based compounds as potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. This manuscript also seeks to contribute to the critical task of teaching and learning chemoinformatics.",

All database entries are now ‘is\_a’ classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds. We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the species and component for metabolites. Finally, our website and web services have had several enhancements, most notably the provision of a dynamic new interactive graph-based ontology visualization.}",

The most recent release of HMDB (version 2.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release (version 1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300\\% increase), while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly, the number of purified compounds with reference to NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS spectra has more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds). In addition to this significant expansion in database size, many new database searching tools and new data content has been added or enhanced. These include better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic maps. Changes to the user-interface have also been implemented to accommodate future expansion and to make database navigation much easier. These improvements should make the HMDB much more useful to a much wider community of users.}",

abstract = {Abstract MassBank is the first public repository of mass spectra of small chemical compounds for life sciences (<3000 Da). The database contains 605 electron-ionization mass spectrometry(EI-MS), 137 fast atom bombardment MS and 9276 electrospray ionization (ESI)-MSn data of 2337 authentic compounds of metabolites, 11 545 EI-MS and 834 other-MS data of 10 286 volatile natural and synthetic compounds, and 3045 ESI-MS2 data of 679 synthetic drugs contributed by 16 research groups (January 2010). ESI-MS2 data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the ESI-MS2 data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS2 data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21–23\% at a similarity score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds and the publication of experimental data. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Natural language processing of free text phenotype descriptions is often easier to apply than intensive curation. It is therefore critical to understand the extent to which these techniques can be used to organize and analyze biological datasets and enable biological discoveries.Results A wide variety of approaches from the natural language processing domain perform as well as similarity metrics over curated annotations for predicting shared phenotypes. These approaches also show promise both for helping curators organize and work through large datasets as well as for enabling researchers to explore relationships among available phenotype descriptions. Here we generate networks of phenotype similarity and share a web application for querying a dataset of associated plant genes using these text mining approaches.

Using multi-omics data as covariate data in outcome prediction is both promising and challenging due to the complex structure of such data. Random forest is a prediction method known for its ability to render complex dependency patterns between the outcome and the covariates. Against this background we developed five candidate random forest variants tailored to multi-omics covariate data. These variants modify the split point selection of random forest to incorporate the block structure of multi-omics data and can be applied to any outcome type for which a random forest variant exists, such as categorical, continuous and survival outcomes. Using 20 publicly available multi-omics data sets with survival outcome we compared the prediction performances of the block forest variants with alternatives. We also considered the common special case of having clinical covariates and measurements of a single omics data type available.",

Semantic Web technologies such as Resource Description Framework can be utilized to their full potential when a clinical data model accurately reflects the reality of the clinical situation it describes. To this end, the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry provides a set of ontologies that conform to the principles of realism and can be used to create a realism-based clinical data model. However, the challenge of programmatically defining such a model and loading data from disparate sources into the model has not been addressed by pre-existing software solutions. The PennTURBO Semantic Engine is a tool developed at the University of Pennsylvania that works in conjunction with data aggregation software to transform source-specific RDF data into a source-independent, realism-based data model. This system sources classes from an application ontology and specifically defines how instances of those classes may relate to each other. Additionally, the system defines and executes RDF data transformations by launching dynamically generated SPARQL update statements. The Semantic Engine was designed as a generalizable RDF data standardization tool, and is able to work with various data models and incoming data sources. Its human-readable configuration files can easily be shared between institutions, providing the basis for collaboration on a standard realism-based clinical data model.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {High accuracy, high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is becoming more common in analytical applications, yet databases of these spectra remain limited. Databases require good quality spectra with sufficient compound information, but processing, calibration, noise reduction and retrieval of compound information are time-consuming tasks that prevent many contributions. We present a comprehensive workflow for the automatic processing of MS/MS using formula annotation for recalibration and cleanup to generate high quality spectra of standard compounds for upload to MassBank (www.massbank.jp). Compound information is retrieved via Internet services. Reference standards of 70 pesticides were measured at various collision energies on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL to develop and evaluate the workflow. A total of 944 resulting spectra are now available on MassBank. Evidence of nitrogen adduct formation during MS/MS fragmentation processes was found, highlighting the benefits high accuracy MS/MS offers for spectral interpretation. A database of recalibrated, cleaned-up spectra resulted in the most correct spectra ranked in first place, regardless of whether the search spectra were recalibrated or not, whereas the average rank of the correct molecular formula was improved from 2.55 (uncalibrated) to 1.53 when using recalibrated MS/MS data. The workflow is available as an R package RMassBank capable of generating MassBank records from raw MS and MS/MS data and can be adjusted to process data acquired with different settings and instruments. This workflow is a vital step towards addressing the need for more high quality, high accuracy MS/MS spectra in spectral databases and provides important information for spectral interpretation.

		Numerous efforts have been undertaken to define such interactomes experimentally, for example yeast-tow-hybrid based protein-protein interaction networks or ChIP-seq based protein-DNA interactions for individual proteins.
			To complement these direct measurements, genome-scale quantitative multi-omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.)  enable researchers to predict novel functional interactions between molecular species.
			Moreover, these data allow to distinguish relevant functional from non-functional interactions in a specific biological context. 
			However, integration of multi-omics data is not straight forward due to their heterogeneity.
			So far, interaction networks have mostly been inferred from homogeneous functional data (e.g. gene co-expression networks) and novel methods are essential for inferring comprehensive regulatory networks across omics data types.

			Here we review state-of-the-art techniques for inferring the topology of interaction networks from functional multi-omics data, encompassing graphical models with multiple node types and quantitative-trait-loci (QTL) based approaches. 
			In addition, we will discuss Bayesian aspects of network inference, which allow for leveraging already established biological information, such as known protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, to guide the inference process.}

To make the ISA framework more accessible to machines and enable programmatic manipulation of experiment metadata, a JSON serialization ISA-JSON was developed. Results: In this work, we present the ISA API, a Python library for the creation, editing, parsing, and validating of ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON formats by using a common data model engineered as Python class objects. We describe the ISA API feature set, early adopters and its growing user community. Conclusions: The ISA API provides users with rich programmatic metadata handling functionality to support automation, a common interface and an interoperable medium between the two ISA formats, as well as with other life science data formats required for depositing data in public databases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In 2014, we launched the Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M; http://workflow4metabolomics.org) online infrastructure for metabolomics built on the Galaxy environment, which offers user-friendly features to build and run data analysis workflows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and annotation steps. Here we present the new W4M 3.0 release, which contains twice as many tools as the first version, and provides two features which are, to our knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major metabolomics technologies (i.e., LC–MS, FIA–MS, GC–MS, and NMR) can be analyzed on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for e-learning and training. The Workflow4Metabolomics 3.0 e-infrastructure thus not only offers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main metabolomics technologies, but it is also the first reference repository for metabolomics workflows."

As scientific domains are deeply interlinked, so too are their representations. While individual ontologies can be tested for consistency and coherency using automated reasoning methods, systematically combining ontologies of multiple domains together may reveal previously hidden contradictions.Results We developed a method that tests for hidden unsatisfiabilities in an ontology that arise when combined with other ontologies. For this purpose, we combine sets of ontologies and use automated reasoning to determine whether unsatisfiable classes are present. We test the mutual consistency of the OBO Foundry and the OBO ontologies and find that the combined OBO Foundry gives rise to at least 636 unsatisfiable classes, while the OBO ontologies give rise to more than 300,000 unsatisfiable classes.We design and implement a novel algorithm that can determine justifications for contradictions across extremely large and complicated ontologies, and use these justifications to semi-automatically repair ontologies by identifying the minimal set of axioms that, when removed, result in a consistent and coherent set of ontologies. We applied our algorithm to each combination of OBO ontologies that resulted in unsatisfiable classes.Conclusions We identified a large set of hidden unsatisfiability across a broad range of biomedical ontologies, and we find that this large set of unsatisfiable classes is the result of a relatively small amount of axiomatic disagreements. Our results show that hidden unsatisfiability is a serious problem in ontology interoperability; however, our results also provide a way towards more consistent ontologies by addressing the issues we identified.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, descriptions of stem-like gene and pathway signatures in cancers are inconsistent across experimental systems. Driven by a need to improve our understanding of molecular processes that are common and unique across cancer stem cells (CSCs), we have developed the Stem Cell Discovery Engine (SCDE)—an online database of curated CSC experiments coupled to the Galaxy analytical framework. The SCDE allows users to consistently describe, share and compare CSC data at the gene and pathway level. Our initial focus has been on carefully curating tissue and cancer stem cell-related experiments from blood, intestine and brain to create a high quality resource containing 53 public studies and 1098 assays. The experimental information is captured and stored in the multi-omics Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA-Tab) format and can be queried in the data repository. A linked Galaxy framework provides a comprehensive, flexible environment populated with novel tools for gene list comparisons against molecular signatures in GeneSigDB and MSigDB, curated experiments in the SCDE and pathways in WikiPathways.

abstract="When reporting research findings, scientists document the steps they followed so that others can verify and build upon the research. When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. The deterministic nature of most computer programs means that the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced because of complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed---and because of limitations associated with how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges; here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe the strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as the circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches.",

    abstract = {The metabolome is a highly dynamic entity and the final readout of the genotype x environment x phenotype (GxExP) relationship of an organism. Monitoring metabolite dynamics over time thus theoretically encrypts the whole range of possible chemical and biochemical transformations of small molecules involved in metabolism. The bottleneck is, however, the sheer number of unidentified structures in these samples. This represents the next challenge for metabolomics technology and is comparable with genome sequencing 30 years ago. At the same time it is impossible to handle the amount of data involved in a metabolomics analysis manually. Algorithms are therefore imperative to allow for automated m/z feature extraction and subsequent structure or pathway assignment. Here we provide an automated pathway inference strategy comprising measurements of metabolome time series using LC- MS with high resolution and high mass accuracy. An algorithm was developed, called mzGroupAnalyzer, to automatically explore the metabolome for the detection of metabolite transformations caused by biochemical or chemical modifications. Pathways are extracted directly from the data and putative novel structures can be identified. The detected m/z features can be mapped on a van Krevelen diagram according to their H/C and O/C ratios for pattern recognition and to visualize oxidative processes and biochemical transformations. This method was applied to Arabidopsis thaliana treated simultaneously with cold and high light. Due to a protective antioxidant response the plants turn from green to purple color via the accumulation of flavonoid structures. The detection of potential biochemical pathways resulted in 15 putatively new compounds involved in the flavonoid-pathway. These compounds were further validated by product ion spectra from the same data. The mzGroupAnalyzer is implemented in the graphical user interface (GUI) of the metabolomics toolbox COVAIN (Sun & Weckwerth, 2012, Metabolomics 8: 81–93). The strategy can be extended to any biological system.},

For the development of classifiers, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least squares discriminant PLS (DPLS) have been used. The low resolution mass spectra were transformed into a set of 400 spectral features. Because each spectrum is described with so many features, some features may not be necessary, and others may contribute only noise. Therefore, the effect of feature selection has been investigated. The methods used were selection by Fisher ratios and selection by a genetic algorithm (GA). The first method is univariate, the second is multivariate; advantages and disadvantages of both are discussed. On the average, feature selection did not significantly change the classification performance compared with results that have been obtained with all features. However, it was possible to reduce the number of features considerably without a loss of classification performance. For a few substructures GA together with LDA resulted in much better classifiers than DPLS with all features. The features selected for classifications of a benzyl substructure and for the presence of chlorine have been interpreted in terms of mass spectrometric fragmentation rules.}

MS/MS mass spectral libraries are small compared to all known small molecule structures and are often not freely available. MS2Analyzer was therefore developed to enable user-defined searches of thousands of spectra for mass spectral features such as neutral losses, m/z differences, and product and precursor ions from MS/MS spectra in MSP/MGF files. The software is freely available at http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/projects/MS2Analyzer/. As the reference query set, 147 literature-reported neutral losses and their corresponding substructures were collected. This set was tested for accuracy of linking neutral loss analysis to substructure annotations using 19 329 accurate mass tandem mass spectra of structurally known compounds from the NIST11 MS/MS library. Validation studies showed that 92.1 ± 6.4\% of 13 typical neutral losses such as acetylations, cysteine conjugates, or glycosylations are correct annotating the associated substructures, while the absence of mass spectra features does not necessarily imply the absence of such substructures. Use of this tool has been successfully demonstrated for complex lipids in microalgae. }

abstract="Metabolite identification is one of the biggest bottlenecks in metabolomics.  Identifying human metabolites poses experimental, analytical, and computational  challenges. Here we present a pipeline of previously developed cheminformatic tools  and demonstrate how it facilitates metabolite identification using solely LC/MS(n)  data. These tools process, annotate, and compare MS(n) data, and propose candidate  structures for unknown metabolites either by identity assignment of identical mass  spectral trees or by de novo identification using substructures of similar trees.  The working and performance of this metabolite identification pipeline is  demonstrated by applying it to LC/MS(n) data of urine samples. From human urine, 30  MS(n) trees of unknown metabolites were acquired, processed, and compared to a  reference database containing MS(n) data of known metabolites. From these 30  unknowns, we could assign a putative identity for 10 unknowns by finding identical  fragmentation trees. For 11 unknowns no similar fragmentation trees were found in  the reference database. On the basis of elemental composition only, a large number  of candidate structures/identities were possible, so these unknowns remained  unidentified. The other 9 unknowns were also not found in the database, but  metabolites with similar fragmentation trees were retrieved. Computer assisted  structure elucidation was performed for these 9 unknowns: for 4 of them we could  perform de novo identification and propose a limited number of candidate structures,  and for the other 5 the structure generation process could not be constrained far  enough to yield a small list of candidates. The novelty of this work is that it  allows de novo identification of metabolites that are not present in a database by  using MS(n) data and computational tools. We expect this pipeline to be the basis  for the computer-assisted identification of new metabolites in future metabolomics  studies, and foresee that further additions will allow the identification of even a  larger fraction of the unknown metabolites.",

Here we  present a novel software-based platform for streamlined data processing, management  and visualization of shotgun lipidomics data acquired using high-resolution Orbitrap  mass spectrometry. The platform features the ALEX framework designed for automated  identification and export of lipid species intensity directly from proprietary mass  spectral data files, and an auxiliary workflow using database exploration tools for  integration of sample information, computation of lipid abundance and lipidome  visualization. A key feature of the platform is the organization of lipidomics data  in ``database table format'' which provides the user with an unsurpassed flexibility  for rapid lipidome navigation using selected features within the dataset. To  demonstrate the efficacy of the platform, we present a comparative neurolipidomics  study of cerebellum, hippocampus and somatosensory barrel cortex (S1BF) from  wild-type and knockout mice devoid of the putative lipid phosphate phosphatase PRG-1  (plasticity related gene-1). The presented framework is generic, extendable to  processing and integration of other lipidomic data structures, can be interfaced  with post-processing protocols supporting statistical testing and multivariate  analysis, and can serve as an avenue for disseminating lipidomics data within the  scientific community.

The SIRIUS method and the parameters used are briefly described, followed by detailed analysis of the results and a discussion of cases where SIRIUS2 was unable to come up with the correct molecular formula. SIRIUS2 returns consistently high quality results, with the exception of fragmentation pattern analysis of time-of-flight data. We then discuss possibilities for further improving SIRIUS2 in the future.},

abstract="Natural products (NPs) have been the centre of attention of the scientific community in the last decencies and the interest around them continues to grow incessantly. As a consequence, in the last 20 years, there was a rapid multiplication of various databases and collections as generalistic or thematic resources for NP information. In this review, we establish a complete overview of these resources, and the numbers are overwhelming: over 120 different NP databases and collections were published and re-used since 2000. 98 of them are still somehow accessible and only 50 are open access. The latter include not only databases but also big collections of NPs published as supplementary material in scientific publications and collections that were backed up in the ZINC database for commercially-available compounds. Some databases, even published relatively recently are already not accessible anymore, which leads to a dramatic loss of data on NPs. The data sources are presented in this manuscript, together with the comparison of the content of open ones. With this review, we also compiled the open-access natural compounds in one single dataset a COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (COCONUT), which is available on Zenodo and contains structures and sparse annotations for over 400,000 non-redundant NPs, which makes it the biggest open collection of NPs available to this date.",

Using imaging, genetic and healthcare data we provide examples of processing heterogeneous datasets using distributed cloud services, automated and semi-automated classification techniques, and open-science protocols. Despite substantial advances, new innovative technologies need to be developed that enhance, scale and optimize the management and processing of large, complex and heterogeneous data. Stakeholder investments in data acquisition, research and development, computational infrastructure and education will be critical to realize the huge potential of big data, to reap the expected information benefits and to build lasting knowledge assets.

This analysis was carried out using calculable chemical structure identifiers developed by the NCI CADD Group, based on hash codes available in the chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS and a newly developed scoring scheme to define a canonical tautomer for any encountered structure. CACTVS's tautomerism definition, a set of 21 transform rules expressed in SMIRKS line notation, was used, which takes a comprehensive stance as to the possible types of tautomeric interconversion included. Tautomerism was found to be possible for more than 2/3 of the unique structures in the CSDB. A total of 680 million tautomers were calculated from, and including, the original structure records. Tautomerism overlap within the same individual database (i.e. at least one other entry was present that was really only a different tautomeric representation of the same compound) was found at an average rate of 0.3{\%} of the original structure records, with values as high as nearly 2{\%} for some of the databases in CSDB. Projected onto the set of unique structures (by FICuS identifier), this still occurred in about 1.5{\%} of the cases. Tautomeric overlap across all constituent databases in CSDB was found for nearly 10{\%} of the records in the collection.",

However, METLIN is not designed to identify metabolites that have been isotopically labeled. As a result, unbiasedly tracking the transformation of labeled metabolites with isotope-based metabolomics is a challenge. Here, we introduce a new database, called isoMETLIN (http://isometlin.scripps.edu/), that has been developed specifically to identify metabolites incorporating isotopic labels. isoMETLIN enables users to search all computed isotopologues derived from METLIN on the basis of mass-to-charge values and specified isotopes of interest, such as 13C or 15N. Additionally, isoMETLIN contains experimental MS/MS data on hundreds of isotopomers. These data assist in localizing the position of isotopic labels within a metabolite. From these experimental MS/MS isotopomer spectra, precursor atoms can be mapped to fragments. The MS/MS spectra of additional isotopomers can then be computationally generated and included within isoMETLIN. Given that isobaric isotopomers cannot be separated chromatographically or by mass but are likely to occur simultaneously in a biological system, we have also implemented a spectral-mixing function in isoMETLIN. This functionality allows users to combine MS/MS spectra from various isotopomers in different ratios to obtain a theoretical MS/MS spectrum that matches the MS/MS spectrum from a biological sample. Thus, by searching MS and MS/MS experimental data, isoMETLIN facilitates the identification of isotopologues as well as isotopomers from biological samples and provides a platform to drive the next generation of isotope-based metabolomic studies. }

abstract="An important step in the reconstruction of a metabolic network is annotation of metabolites. Metabolites are generally annotated with various database or structure based identifiers. Metabolite annotations in metabolic reconstructions may be incorrect or incomplete and thus need to be updated prior to their use. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions generally include hundreds of metabolites. Manually updating annotations is therefore highly laborious. This prompted us to look for open-source software applications that could facilitate automatic updating of annotations by mapping between available metabolite identifiers. We identified three applications developed for the metabolomics and chemical informatics communities as potential solutions. The applications were MetMask, the Chemical Translation System, and UniChem. The first implements a ``metabolite masking'' strategy for mapping between identifiers whereas the latter two implement different versions of an InChI based strategy. Here we evaluated the suitability of these applications for the task of mapping between metabolite identifiers in genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. We applied the best suited application to updating identifiers in Recon 2, the latest reconstruction of human metabolism.",

abstract="A wide range of chemical compound databases are currently available for pharmaceutical research. To retrieve compound information, including structures, researchers can query these chemical databases using non-systematic identifiers. These are source-dependent identifiers (e.g., brand names, generic names), which are usually assigned to the compound at the point of registration. The correctness of non-systematic identifiers (i.e., whether an identifier matches the associated structure) can only be assessed manually, which is cumbersome, but it is possible to automatically check their ambiguity (i.e., whether an identifier matches more than one structure). In this study we have quantified the ambiguity of non-systematic identifiers within and between eight widely used chemical databases. We also studied the effect of chemical structure standardization on reducing the ambiguity of non-systematic identifiers.",

abstract = {At present, mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics has been widely used to obtain new insights into human, plant, and microbial biochemistry; drug and biomarker discovery; nutrition research; and food control. Despite the high research interest, identifying and characterizing the structure of metabolites has become a major drawback for converting raw MS data into biological knowledge. Comprehensive and well-annotated MS-based spectral databases play a key role in serving this purpose via the formation of metabolite annotations. The main characteristics of the mass spectral databases currently used in MS-based metabolomics are reviewed in this study, underlining their advantages and limitations. In addition, the overlap of compounds with MSn (n ≥ 2) spectra from authentic chemical standards in most public and commercial databases has been calculated for the first time. Finally, future prospects of mass spectral databases are discussed in terms of the needs posed by novel applications and instrumental advancements.}

Experimental adsorption isotherms of 2-propanol and of dioxane in n-heptane suggest that the concentration of the polar solvents in the stationary phase is practically independent of their concentration in mobile phases containing more than 1–3% (v,v) polar solvent. In gradient elution starting at this (or at a higher) concentration of the polar solvent, the effect of the preferential adsorption is small and the differences between the calculated gradient volumes and the experimental data were in most cases less than 0.25 ml, or 2%. Predictive calculations were based on two- and three-parameter equations describing the dependence of the sample capacity factors (isocratic) on the concentration of the polar solvent in the mobile phase, the latter yielding slightly better agreement with the experiment. Possible migration of sample compounds in the mobile phase of initial composition in the gradient dwell volume was accounted for.}

Meanwhile, prediction of the retention time for a given peptide, combined with routine MS/MS data analysis, could help to improve the confidence of peptide identifications. Recently, a number of models has been proposed to characterize quantitatively the structure of a peptide and to predict its gradient RP-HPLC retention at given separation conditions. The chromatographic behavior of peptides has usually been related to their amino acid composition. However, different values of retention coefficients of the same amino acid in different peptides at different neighborhoods were commonly observed. Therefore, specific retention coefficients were derived by regression analysis or by artificial neural networks (ANNs) with the use of a set of peptides retention. In the review, various approaches for peptide elution time prediction in RP-HPLC are presented and critically discussed. The contribution of sequence dependent parameters (e.g., amphipathicity or peptide sequence) and peptide physicochemical descriptors (e.g., hydrophobicity or peptide length) that have been shown to affect the peptide retention time in LC are considered and analyzed. The predictive capability of the retention time prediction models based on quantitative structure–retention relationships (QSRRs) are discussed in details. Advantages and limitations of various retention prediction strategies are identified. It is concluded that proper processing of chromatographic data by statistical learning techniques can result in information of direct use for proteomics, which is otherwise wasted.},

We describe a six-peptide mixture designed for this purpose; its members cover a wide range of hydrophobicity for the most popular modes of reversed-phase peptide high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC): C18 sorbents with trifluoroacetic/formic acid as the ion-pairing modifier and separations at pH 10. We propose a hydrophobicity index (HI) describing the concentration of organic solvent (typically acetonitrile) that yields a retention factor of 10 under isocratic elution conditions for any peptide. This measure is a fundamental characteristic of peptide-sorbent interaction, depending only on the type of sorbent and the ion-pairing modifier used. Spiking a sample with a standard peptide mixture provides a measurement of the HI values of all detected species during gradient separation. In addition to alignment of data and calibration of chromatographic runs when peptide retention prediction protocols are used, these values obtained from proteomics experiments can be utilized directly in method development for large-scale preparative separations. }

Augmenting MS information with HPLC retention information allows many more to be identified. In fact, our calculations indicate that a quadrupole MS is able to identify more compounds than an FTICR-MS when the quadrupole spectrum is augmented with retention information. Unfortunately, retention information is extremely difficult to harness for compound identification. Here, we demonstrate the first use of isocratic data measured on one LC–MS to “project” gradient retention on to different LC–MS systems. Using 35 chemically diverse solutes chosen to encompass the full range of reversed-phase alkylsilica interactions, and using experimental conditions typical of metabolomics experiments, gradient retention was projected from one instrument to another with only 1.2–2.6% error—enough accuracy to considerably improve compound identification. Besides accounting for nonlinear relationships of retention versus solvent composition as well as dead time versus solvent composition, accounting for the precise shape of the gradient profile (not just the dwell volume) improved projection accuracy on one instrument by up to 4 fold whereas flow rate non-idealities likely caused considerable error on the other instrument. Thus, these two factors must be taken into account to accurately project retention on diverse instrumentation.}

Our previous work suggested that in order to accurately calculate (or “project”) gradient retention times on a wide range of HPLC systems using a single set of isocratic retention data, the precise shape of both the gradient and flow rate profiles produced by each instrument must be properly taken into account. However, accurate measurement of these system properties is difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we describe an approach that uses the measured gradient retention times of a set of standard solutes spiked into the sample along with their known isocratic retention vs. eluent composition relationships to determine the effective gradient and flow rate profiles by back-calculation. Retention “projections” of 20 other solutes using these back-calculated profiles, under various chromatographic conditions typical of metabolomics experiments, were remarkably accurate (as good as 0.23% of the gradient time, R2 up to 0.99996), being very near the level of retention reproducibility. Our calculations suggest that this level of accuracy will allow a quadrupole MS to identify 38-fold more compounds out of a simulated mixture of 7307; it would allow an FTICR-MS to improve its identification rate nearly two-fold with the same mixture. Moreover, very little effort is required of the user. This approach provides a simple way to correct for all instrument-related factors affecting retention, allowing dramatically streamlined and improved retention projection across gradients, flow rates, and HPLC instruments.}

Recent advances in HPLC technology led to the development of ultrahigh-performance instruments that allow rapid sample analysis with high efficiency. Nevertheless, there is still the opportunity to increase the sample throughput and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by the application of multiplexing, where the injected samples are encoded with defined sequences. The obtained signal is then deconvoluted to give conventional chromatograms. In this work we present a method and technique which can be easily implemented in commercially available HPLC instruments to perform multiplexing analysis. Using our approach, multiplexing can be performed on standard laboratory equipment by software control and offers an inherent advantage in sensitivity and minimization of analysis time, demonstrated for the analysis of highly diluted polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) samples in water. }

abstract="Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) is widely used in metabolomics due to its sensitivity, reproducibility, speed and versatility. Metabolites are detected as peaks which are characterised by mass-over-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (rt), and one of the most critical but also the most challenging tasks in metabolomics is to annotate the large number of peaks detected in biological samples. Accurate m/z measurements enable the prediction of molecular formulae which provide clues to the chemical identity of peaks, but often a number of metabolites have identical molecular formulae. Chromatographic behaviour, reflecting the physicochemical properties of metabolites, should also provide structural information. However, the variation in rt between analytical runs, and the complicating factors underlying the observed time shifts, make the use of such information for peak annotation a non-trivial task. To this end, we conducted Quantitative Structure--Retention Relationship (QSRR) modelling between the calculated molecular descriptors (MDs) and the experimental retention times (rts) of 93 authentic compounds analysed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to high resolution MS. A predictive QSRR model based on Random Forests algorithm outperformed a Multiple Linear Regression based model, and achieved a high correlation between predicted rts and experimental rts (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.97), with mean and median absolute error of 0.52 min and 0.34 min (corresponding to 5.1 and 3.2 {\%} error), respectively. We demonstrate that rt prediction with the precision achieved enables the systematic utilisation of rts for annotating unknown peaks detected in a metabolomics study. The application of the QSRR model with the strategy we outlined enhanced the peak annotation process by reducing the number of false positives resulting from database queries by matching accurate mass alone, and enriching the reference library. The predicted rts were validated using either authentic compounds or ion fragmentation patterns.",

Comparatively little attention has been afforded to using retention times (RTs) to distinguish compounds and for liquid chromatography there are currently no coordinated efforts to share and exploit RT information. We therefore present PredRet; the first tool that makes community sharing of RT information possible across laboratories and chromatographic systems (CSs). At http://predret.org, a database of RTs from different CSs is available and users can upload their own experimental RTs and download predicted RTs for compounds which they have not experimentally determined in their own experiments. For each possible pair of CSs in the database, the RTs are used to construct a projection model between the RTs in the two CSs. The number of compounds for which RTs can be predicted and the accuracy of the predictions are dependent upon the compound coverage overlap between the CSs used for construction of projection models. At the moment, it is possible to predict up to 400 RTs with a median error between 0.01 and 0.28 min depending on the CS and the median width of the prediction interval ranging from 0.08 to 1.86 min. By comparing experimental and predicted RTs, the user can thus prioritize which isomers to target for further characterization and potentially exclude some structures completely. As the database grows, the number and accuracy of predictions will increase. }

In this unusual application, the Volsurf + molecular descriptors demonstrated a high ability to describe chromatographic retention. On external validation sets, and for a wide range of chemical classes, predicted values were in average within 13 {\%} of the experimentally observed retention time. More importantly, the presented procedure reduced by more than 80 {\%} the number of false putative identification, greatly improving metabolite identification. Furthermore, in 95 {\%} of cases, the correct identification was promoted within the top three metabolite suggestions. This retention time prediction framework can be replicated by different laboratories to suit their profiling platforms and enhance the value of standard library by providing a new tool for compound identification.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is a widely used classificatory  technique in many areas of scientific knowledge. Applications usually yield a  dendrogram from an HCA run over a given data set, using a grouping algorithm and a  similarity measure. However, even when such parameters are fixed, ties in proximity  (i.e. two equidistant clusters from a third one) may produce several different  dendrograms, having different possible clustering patterns (different  classifications). This situation is usually disregarded and conclusions are based on  a single result, leading to questions concerning the permanence of clusters in all  the resulting dendrograms; this happens, for example, when using HCA for grouping  molecular descriptors to select that less similar ones in QSAR studies. RESULTS:  Representing dendrograms in graph theoretical terms allowed us to introduce four  measures of cluster frequency in a canonical way, and use them to calculate cluster  frequencies over the set of all possible dendrograms, taking all ties in proximity  into account. A toy example of well separated clusters was used, as well as a set of  1666 molecular descriptors calculated for a group of molecules having hepatotoxic  activity to show how our functions may be used for studying the effect of ties in  HCA analysis. Such functions were not restricted to the tie case; the possibility of  using them to derive cluster stability measurements on arbitrary sets of dendrograms  having the same leaves is discussed, e.g. dendrograms from variations of HCA  parameters. It was found that ties occurred frequently, some yielding tens of  thousands of dendrograms, even for small data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach was  able to detect trends in clustering patterns by offering a simple way of measuring  their frequency, which is often very low. This would imply, that inferences and  models based on descriptor classifications (e.g. QSAR) are likely to be biased,  thereby requiring an assessment of their reliability. Moreover, any classification  of molecular descriptors is likely to be far from unique. Our results highlight the  need for evaluating the effect of ties on clustering patterns before classification  results can be used accurately.Graphical abstractFour cluster contrast functions  identifying statistically sound clusters within dendrograms considering ties in  proximity.",

    abstract = { Metabolomics is an emerging field of postgenomic biology concerned with comprehensive analysis of small molecules in biological systems. However, difficulties associated with the identification of detected metabolites currently limit its application. Here we demonstrate that a retention time prediction model can improve metabolite identification on a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)–high-resolution mass spectrometry metabolomics platform. A quantitative structure retention relationship (QSRR) model, incorporating six physicochemical variables in a multiple-linear regression based on 120 authentic standard metabolites, shows good predictive ability for retention times of a range of metabolites (cross-validated R2 = 0.82 and mean squared error = 0.14). The predicted retention times improved metabolite identification by removing 40\% of the false identifications that occurred with identification by accurate mass alone. The importance of this procedure was demonstrated by putative identification of 690 metabolites in extracts of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, thus allowing identified metabolites to be mapped onto an organism-wide metabolic network, providing opportunities for future studies of cellular metabolism from a global systems biology perspective. }

Analysis of five major metabolic pathway databases reveals that each database has made widely different choices to address this challenge, including how to deal with knowledge that is uncertain or missing. In concise overviews, we show how concepts such as compartments, enzymatic complexes and the direction of reactions are represented in each database. Importantly, also concepts which a database does not represent are described. Which aspects of the metabolic network need to be available in a structured format and to what detail differs per application. For example, for in silico phenotype prediction, a detailed representation of gene–protein–reaction relations and the compartmentalization of the network is essential. Our analysis also shows that current databases are still limited in capturing all details of the biology of the metabolic network, further illustrated with a detailed analysis of three metabolic processes. Finally, we conclude that the conceptual differences between the databases, which make knowledge exchange and integration a challenge, have not been resolved, so far, by the exchange formats in which knowledge representation is standardized.}",

As biological networks are very complex in nature, proper techniques and models need to be chosen for their better understanding and interpretation. One of the useful strategies in this regard is using path mining strategies and graph-theoretical approaches that help in building hypothetical models and perform quantitative analysis. Furthermore, they also contribute to analyzing topological parameters in metabolome networks. Path mining techniques can be based on grammars, keys, patterns and indexing. Moreover, they can also be used for modeling metabolome networks, finding structural similarities between metabolites, in-silico metabolic engineering, shortest path estimation and for various graph-based analysis.

abstract="Thousands of articles using metabolomics approaches are published every year. With  the increasing amounts of data being produced, mere description of investigations as  text in manuscripts is not sufficient to enable re-use anymore: the underlying data  needs to be published together with the findings in the literature to maximise the  benefit from public and private expenditure and to take advantage of an enormous  opportunity to improve scientific reproducibility in metabolomics and cognate  disciplines. Reporting recommendations in metabolomics started to emerge about a  decade ago and were mostly concerned with inventories of the information that had to  be reported in the literature for consistency. In recent years, metabolomics data  standards have developed extensively, to include the primary research data, derived  results and the experimental description and importantly the metadata in a  machine-readable way. This includes vendor independent data standards such as mzML  for mass spectrometry and nmrML for NMR raw data that have both enabled the  development of advanced data processing algorithms by the scientific community.  Standards such as ISA-Tab cover essential metadata, including the experimental  design, the applied protocols, association between samples, data files and the  experimental factors for further statistical analysis. Altogether, they pave the way  for both reproducible research and data reuse, including meta-analyses. Further  incentives to prepare standards compliant data sets include new opportunities to  publish data sets, but also require a little ``arm twisting'' in the author guidelines  of scientific journals to submit the data sets to public repositories such as the  NIH Metabolomics Workbench or MetaboLights at EMBL-EBI. In the present article, we  look at standards for data sharing, investigate their impact in metabolomics and  give suggestions to improve their adoption.",

Machine learning methods have been proposed recently to solve this problem by predicting molecular fingerprint vectors and matching these fingerprints against existing molecular structure databases. In this work we propose to address the metabolite identification problem using a structured output prediction approach. This type of approach is not limited to vector output space and can handle structured output space such as the molecule space. Results: We use the Input Output Kernel Regression method to learn the mapping between tandem mass spectra and molecular structures. The principle of this method is to encode the similarities in the input (spectra) space and the similarities in the output (molecule) space using two kernel functions. This method approximates the spectra-molecule mapping in two phases. The first phase corresponds to a regression problem from the input space to the feature space associated to the output kernel. The second phase is a preimage problem, consisting in mapping back the predicted output feature vectors to the molecule space. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in metabolite identification. Moreover, our method has the advantage of decreasing the running times for the training step and the test step by several orders of magnitude over the preceding methods.

This work describes a highly sensitive, broadly applicable, and cost-effective approach that allows metabolic profiling of live microbial colonies directly from a Petri dish without any sample preparation. Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS), combined with alignment of MS data and molecular networking, enabled monitoring of metabolite production from live microbial colonies from diverse bacterial genera, including Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This work demonstrates that, by using these tools to visualize small molecular changes within bacterial interactions, insights can be gained into bacterial developmental processes as a result of the improved organization of MS/MS data. To validate this experimental platform, metabolic profiling was performed on Pseudomonas sp. SH-C52, which protects sugar beet plants from infections by specific soil-borne fungi [R. Mendes et al. (2011) Science 332:1097{\textendash}1100]. The antifungal effect of strain SH-C52 was attributed to thanamycin, a predicted lipopeptide encoded by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster. Our technology, in combination with our recently developed peptidogenomics strategy, enabled the detection and partial characterization of thanamycin and showed that it is a monochlorinated lipopeptide that belongs to the syringomycin family of antifungal agents. In conclusion, the platform presented here provides a significant advancement in our ability to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of metabolite production in live microbial colonies and communities.},

While the computational tools currently available such as XCMS statistically assess and rank LC-MS features, they do not provide information about their structural identity. XCMS2 is an open source software package which has been developed to automatically search tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data against high quality experimental MS/MS data from known metabolites contained in a reference library (METLIN). Scoring of hits is based on a “shared peak count” method that identifies masses of fragment ions shared between the analytical and reference MS/MS spectra. Another functional component of XCMS2 is the capability of providing structural information for unknown metabolites, which are not in the METLIN database. This “similarity search” algorithm has been developed to detect possible structural motifs in the unknown metabolite which may produce characteristic fragment ions and neutral losses to related reference compounds contained in METLIN, even if the precursor masses are not the same. }

Currently, little is known about these data, i.e. about their distributions across datasets, the need (or not) to consider them in the data processing pipeline, and most importantly, the optimal way of assigning them values prior to univariate or multivariate data analysis. Here, we address all of these issues using direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data. We have shown that missing data are widespread, accounting for ca. 20{\%} of data and affecting up to 80{\%} of all variables, and that they do not occur randomly but rather as a function of signal intensity and mass-to-charge ratio. We have demonstrated that missing data estimation algorithms have a major effect on the outcome of data analysis when comparing the differences between biological sample groups, including by t test, ANOVA and principal component analysis. Furthermore, results varied significantly across the eight algorithms that we assessed for their ability to impute known, but labelled as missing, entries. Based on all of our findings we identified the k-nearest neighbour imputation method (KNN) as the optimal missing value estimation approach for our direct infusion mass spectrometry datasets. However, we believe the wider significance of this study is that it highlights the importance of missing metabolite levels in the data processing pipeline and offers an approach to identify optimal ways of treating missing data in metabolomics experiments.",

    abstract = { Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) metabolite profiling has been widely used in comparative metabolomics studies; however, LC/MS-based comparative metabolomics currently faces several critical challenges. One of the greatest challenges is how to effectively align metabolites across different LC/MS profiles; a single metabolite can give rise to multiple peak features, and the grouped peak features that can be used to construct a spectrum pattern of single metabolite can vary greatly between biochemical experiments and even between instrument runs. Another major challenge is that the observed retention time for a single metabolite can also be significantly affected by experimental conditions. To overcome these two key challenges, we present a novel metabolite-based alignment approach entitled MET-XAlign to align metabolites across LC/MS metabolomics profiles. MET-XAlign takes the deduced molecular mass and estimated compound retention time information that can be extracted by our previously published tool, MET-COFEA, and aligns metabolites based on this information. We demonstrate that MET-XAlign is able to cross-align metabolite compounds, either known or unknown, in LC/MS profiles not only across different samples but also across different biological experiments and different electrospray ionization modes. Therefore, our proposed metabolite-based cross-alignment approach is a great step forward and its implementation, MET-XAlign, is a very useful tool in LC/MS-based comparative metabolomics. MET-XAlign has been successfully implemented with core algorithm coding in C++, making it very efficient, and visualization interface coding in the Microsoft.NET Framework. The MET-XAlign software along with demonstrative data is freely available at http://bioinfo.noble.org/manuscript-support/met-xalign/. }

    abstract = { Active data screening is an integral part of many scientific activities, and mobile technologies have greatly facilitated this process by minimizing the reliance on large hardware instrumentation. In order to meet with the increasingly growing field of metabolomics and heavy workload of data processing, we designed the first remote metabolomic data screening platform for mobile devices. Two mobile applications (apps), XCMS Mobile and METLIN Mobile, facilitate access to XCMS and METLIN, which are the most important components in the computer-based XCMS Online platforms. These mobile apps allow for the visualization and analysis of metabolic data throughout the entire analytical process. Specifically, XCMS Mobile and METLIN Mobile provide the capabilities for remote monitoring of data processing, real time notifications for the data processing, visualization and interactive analysis of processed data (e.g., cloud plots, principle component analysis, box-plots, extracted ion chromatograms, and hierarchical cluster analysis), and database searching for metabolite identification. These apps, available on Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems, allow for the migration of metabolomic research onto mobile devices for better accessibility beyond direct instrument operation. The utility of XCMS Mobile and METLIN Mobile functionalities was developed and is demonstrated here through the metabolomic LC-MS analyses of stem cells, colon cancer, aging, and bacterial metabolism. }

The need for high accuracy and performance computational label-free quantitation methods is still high in the biomarker and drug discovery research field. However, recent most advanced types of LC-MS generate huge amounts of analytical data with high scan speed, high accuracy and resolution, which is often impossible to interpret manually. Moreover, there are still issues to be improved for recent label-free methods, such as how to reduce false positive/negatives of the candidate peaks, how to expand scalability and how to enhance and automate data processing. AB3D (A simple label-free quantitation algorithm for Biomarker Discovery in Diagnostics and Drug discovery using LC-MS) has addressed these issues and has the capability to perform label-free quantitation using MS1 for proteomics study.",

abstract = {A method is presented for extracting individual component spectra from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data files and then using these spectra to identify target compounds by matching spectra in a reference library. It extends a published “model peak” approach which uses selected ion chromatograms as models for component shape. On the basis of this shape, individual mass spectral peak abundance profiles are extracted to produce a “purified” spectrum. In the present work, ion-counting noise is explicitly treated and a number of characteristic features of GC/MS data are taken into account. This allows spectrum extraction to be reliably performed down to very low signal levels and for overlapping components. A spectrum match factor for compound identification is developed that incorporates a number of new corrections, some of which employ information derived from chromatographic behavior. Test results suggest that the ability of this system to identify compounds is comparable to that of conventional analysis.}

However, as we shall indicate in this work, many factors can profoundly affect parameter requirements for optimal metabolite identification. There was an immediate need for an automated and efficient approach to take into account how these variables affect parameter requirements, in order to achieve sound conclusions and a good understanding of biological system behavior. We described a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach to calibrate critical parameters, which can be highly specific to individual experiments depending on analytical conditions and objectives. The procedure was designed to improve peak-group annotation, target pathway analysis and global metabolite identification in a concurrent, efficient and synergistic manner. In this way, it enhanced the capability of the core pre-processing pipeline. Importantly, together with the compilation of lipid ionization rules, this parameter search framework enabled us to expand the scope of analysis to include lipidomics. We demonstrated its practical applicability via three different case studies. In all, GA-based pre-processing pipelines are highly suitable for the multi-faceted analysis of highly heterogeneous bioprocessing and clinical experiments.",

abstract="Metabolite identification remains a bottleneck in mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics. Currently, this process relies heavily on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra generated separately for peaks of interest identified from previous MS runs. Such a delayed and labor-intensive procedure creates a barrier to automation. Further, information embedded in MS data has not been used to its full extent for metabolite identification. Multimers, adducts, multiply charged ions, and fragments of given metabolites occupy a substantial proportion (40--80{\%}) of the peaks of a quantitation result. However, extensive information on these derivatives, especially fragments, may facilitate metabolite identification. We propose a procedure with automation capability to group and annotate peaks associated with the same metabolite in the quantitation results of opposite modes and to integrate this information for metabolite identification. In addition to the conventional mass and isotope ratio matches, we would match annotated fragments with low-energy MS/MS spectra in public databases. For identification of metabolites without accessible MS/MS spectra, we have developed characteristic fragment and common substructure matches. The accuracy and effectiveness of the procedure were evaluated using one public and two in-house liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (LC--MS) data sets. The procedure accurately identified 89{\%} of 28 standard metabolites with derivative ions in the data sets. With respect to effectiveness, the procedure confidently identified the correct chemical formula of at least 42{\%} of metabolites with derivative ions via MS/MS spectrum, characteristic fragment, and common substructure matches. The confidence level was determined according to the fulfilled identification criteria of various matches and relative retention time.",

abstract="Recently, the interests in proteomics have been intensively increased, and the proteomic methods have been widely applied to many problems in cell biology. If the age of 1990s is considered to be a decade of genomics, we can claim that the following years of the new century is a decade of proteomics. The rapid evolution of proteomics has continued through these years, with a series of innovations in separation techniques and the core technologies of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MS. Both technologies are fueled by automation and high throughput computation for profiling of proteins from biological systems. As Patterson ever mentioned, `data analysis is the Achilles heel of proteomics and our ability to generate data now outstrips our ability to analyze it'. The development of automatic and high throughput technologies for rapid identification of proteins is essential for large-scale proteome projects and automatic protein identification and characterization is essential for high throughput proteomics. This review provides a snap shot of the tools and applications that are available for mass spectrometric high throughput biocomputation. The review starts with a brief introduction of proteomics and MS. Computational tools that can be employed at various stages of analysis are presented, including that for data processing, identification, quantification, and the understanding of the biological functions of individual proteins and their dynamic interactions. The challenges of computation software development and its future trends in MS-based proteomics have also been speculated. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.",

Thanks to its high mass resolution and mass measurement accuracy, it is also very useful for metabolite identification. Nevertheless, a rigorous methodology is required.

After a brief overview of HRMS performances in terms of mass measurement accuracy, peak resolution, isotopic clusters/patterns and the instrumentation used, the first section is devoted to the data processing generally performed to reduce the data set size. Based on the mass accuracy measurements, different post-acquisition data processing procedures have been developed for complex mixture analysis and can be used in metabolomics. The second section describes protocols used to process putative metabolite annotations or identifications with HRMS data, based on elemental composition determined from accurately measured m/z value and mass spectral databases. Non-classical approaches are also proposed for tentative structure elucidation of unknown metabolites.

abstract="Mass spectrometry (MS) is an important analytical technique for the detection and identification of small compounds. The main bottleneck in the interpretation of metabolite profiling or screening experiments is the identification of unknown compounds from tandem mass spectra. Spectral libraries for tandem MS, such as MassBank or NIST, contain reference spectra for many compounds, but their limited chemical coverage reduces the chance for a correct and reliable identification of unknown spectra outside the database domain. On the other hand, compound databases like PubChem or ChemSpider have a much larger coverage of the chemical space, but they cannot be queried with spectral information directly. Recently, computational mass spectrometry methods and in silico fragmentation prediction allow users to search such databases of chemical structures. We present a new strategy called MetFusion to combine identification results from several resources, in particular, from the in silico fragmenter MetFrag with the spectral library MassBank to improve compound identification. We evaluate the performance on a set of 1062 spectra and achieve an improved ranking of the correct compound from rank 28 using MetFrag alone, to rank 7 with MetFusion, even if the correct compound and similar compounds are absent from the spectral library. On the basis of the evaluation, we extrapolate the performance of MetFusion to the KEGG compound database. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.",

For each adequate region, stochastic gradient boosting tree regression model is constructed. By constructing hundreds of these models, MS2PBPI is able to predict MS/MS spectra for unmodified and modified peptides with reasonable accuracy.

Various computational methods have been proposed for the identification of metabolites from tandem mass spectra. Fragmentation tree methods explore the space of possible ways in which the metabolite can fragment, and base the metabolite identification on scoring of these fragmentation trees. Machine learning methods have been used to map mass spectra to molecular fingerprints; predicted fingerprints, in turn, can be used to score candidate molecular structures.Results: Here, we combine fragmentation tree computations with kernel-based machine learning to predict molecular fingerprints and identify molecular structures. We introduce a family of kernels capturing the similarity of fragmentation trees, and combine these kernels using recently proposed multiple kernel learning approaches. Experiments on two large reference datasets show that the new methods significantly improve molecular fingerprint prediction accuracy. These improvements result in better metabolite identification, doubling the number of metabolites ranked at the top position of the candidates list.Contact:huibin.shen@aalto.fiSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract="A database searching approach can be used for metabolite identification in metabolomics by matching measured tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) against the predicted fragments of metabolites in a database. Here, we present the open-source MIDAS algorithm (Metabolite Identification via Database Searching). To evaluate a metabolite-spectrum match (MSM), MIDAS first enumerates possible fragments from a metabolite by systematic bond dissociation, then calculates the plausibility of the fragments based on their fragmentation pathways, and finally scores the MSM to assess how well the experimental MS/MS spectrum from collision-induced dissociation (CID) is explained by the metabolite's predicted CID MS/MS spectrum. MIDAS was designed to search high-resolution tandem mass spectra acquired on time-of-flight or Orbitrap mass spectrometer against a metabolite database in an automated and high-throughput manner. The accuracy of metabolite identification by MIDAS was benchmarked using four sets of standard tandem mass spectra from MassBank. On average, for 77{\%} of original spectra and 84{\%} of composite spectra, MIDAS correctly ranked the true compounds as the first MSMs out of all MetaCyc metabolites as decoys. MIDAS correctly identified 46{\%} more original spectra and 59{\%} more composite spectra at the first MSMs than an existing database-searching algorithm, MetFrag. MIDAS was showcased by searching a published real-world measurement of a metabolome from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 against the MetaCyc metabolite database. MIDAS identified many metabolites missed in the previous study. MIDAS identifications should be considered only as candidate metabolites, which need to be confirmed using standard compounds. To facilitate manual validation, MIDAS provides annotated spectra for MSMs and labels observed mass spectral peaks with predicted fragments. The database searching and manual validation can be performed online at http://midas.omicsbio.org.",

This spectral library is hosted at the public MCID Web site (www.MyCompoundID.org), and a spectral search program, MCID MS/MS, has been developed to allow a user to search one or a batch of experimental MS/MS spectra against the library spectra for possible match(s). Using MS/MS spectra generated from standard metabolites and a human urine sample, we demonstrate that this tool is very useful for putative metabolite identification. It allows a user to narrow down many possible structures initially found by using an accurate mass search of an unknown metabolite to only one or a few candidates, thereby saving time and effort in selecting or synthesizing metabolite standard(s) for eventual positive metabolite identification.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry analyses of complex protein samples yield large  amounts of data and specific expertise is needed for data analysis, in addition to a  dedicated computer infrastructure. Furthermore, the identification of proteins and  their specific properties require the use of multiple independent bioinformatics  tools and several database search algorithms to process the same datasets. In order  to facilitate and increase the speed of data analysis, there is a need for an  integrated platform that would allow a comprehensive profiling of thousands of  peptides and proteins in a single process through the simultaneous exploitation of  multiple complementary algorithms. RESULTS: We have established a new proteomics  pipeline designated as APP that fulfills these objectives using a complete series of  tools freely available from open sources. APP automates the processing of proteomics  tasks such as peptide identification, validation and quantitation from LC-MS/MS data  and allows easy integration of many separate proteomics tools. Distributed  processing is at the core of APP, allowing the processing of very large datasets  using any combination of Windows/Linux physical or virtual computing resources.  CONCLUSIONS: APP provides distributed computing nodes that are simple to set up,  greatly relieving the need for separate IT competence when handling large datasets.  The modular nature of APP allows complex workflows to be managed and distributed,  speeding up throughput and setup. Additionally, APP logs execution information on  all executed tasks and generated results, simplifying information management and  validation.",

abstract="XCMS Online (xcmsonline.scripps.edu) is a cloud-based informatic platform designed to process and visualize mass-spectrometry-based, untargeted metabolomic data. Initially, the platform was developed for two-group comparisons to match the independent, ``control'' versus ``disease'' experimental design. Here, we introduce an enhanced XCMS Online interface that enables users to perform dependent (paired) two-group comparisons, meta-analysis, and multigroup comparisons, with comprehensive statistical output and interactive visualization tools. Newly incorporated statistical tests cover a wide array of univariate analyses. Multigroup comparison allows for the identification of differentially expressed metabolite features across multiple classes of data while higher order meta-analysis facilitates the identification of shared metabolic patterns across multiple two-group comparisons. Given the complexity of these data sets, we have developed an interactive platform where users can monitor the statistical output of univariate (cloud plots) and multivariate (PCA plots) data analysis in real time by adjusting the threshold and range of various parameters. On the interactive cloud plot, metabolite features can be filtered out by their significance level (p-value), fold change, mass-to-charge ratio, retention time, and intensity. The variation pattern of each feature can be visualized on both extracted-ion chromatograms and box plots. The interactive principal component analysis includes scores, loadings, and scree plots that can be adjusted depending on scaling criteria. The utility of XCMS functionalities is demonstrated through the metabolomic analysis of bacterial stress response and the comparison of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.",

abstract="Simultaneous high-resolution full-scan and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis using time of flight mass spectrometry brings an answer for increasing demand of retrospective and non-targeted data analysis. Such analysis combined with spectral library searching is a promising tool for targeted and untargeted screening of small molecules. Despite considerable extension of the panel of compounds of tandem mass spectral libraries, the heterogeneity of spectral data poses a major challenge against the effective usage of spectral libraries. Performance evaluation of available LC-MS/MS libraries will significantly increase credibility in the search results. The present work was aimed to evaluate fluctuation of MS/MS pattern, in the peak intensities distribution together with mass accuracy measurements, and in consequence, performance compliant with ion ratio and mass error criteria as principles in identification processes for targeted and untargeted contaminants at trace levels. Matrix effect and ultra-trace levels of concentration (from 50{\thinspace}ng{\thinspace}l-1 to 1000{\thinspace}ng{\thinspace}l-1) were evaluated as potential source of inaccuracy in the performance of spectral matching. Matrix-matched samples and real samples were screened for proof of applicability. By manual review of data and application of ion ratio and ppm error criteria, false negatives were obtained; this number diminished when in-house library was used, while with on-line MS/MS databases 100{\%} of positive samples were found. In our experience, intensity of peaks across spectra was highly correlated to the concentration effect and matrix complexity. In turn, analysis of spectra acquired at trace concentrations and in different matrices results in better performance in providing correct and reliable identification.

Although previously tandem mass spectrometry data have been generated on the fly, the experiments described herein combine this technology with the bioinformatic resources of XCMS and METLIN. As a result of this unique integration, we can analyze large profiling datasets and simultaneously obtain structural identifications. Validation of the workflow on bacterial samples allowed the profiling on the order of a thousand metabolite features with simultaneous tandem mass spectra data acquisition. The tandem mass spectrometry data acquisition enabled automatic search and matching against the METLIN tandem mass spectrometry database, shortening the current workflow from days to hours.

abstract="This work presents a method for using mass spectral match factors reported by library search systems to obtain certain probabilistic indicators of correct identification. The overall probability that a retrieval is correct is formally separated into two independent terms. One of these is the probability that a retrieval is correct assuming that the correct match is contained in the library. This can be computed directly from test results. The other term represents the probability that the spectrum of the unknown compound is actually in the library. While the absolute value of this term cannot be computed, a relative value based solely on search results can be derived. This value may, if desired, be used to refine an initial estimate of the overall probability. Parameters used in this calculation are based on changes in test results caused by the logical removal of the test compounds from the library. These methods were parameterized from results of searching the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Database with 12,592 good quality replicate spectra and a simple mass spectral comparison function. The methodology should be equally applicable to other libraries and search systems.",

The test set consisted of 12,592 alternate spectra of about 8000 compounds represented in the database. Most algorithms were optimized by varying their mass weighting and intensity scaling factors. Rank in the list of candidatc compounds was used as the criterion for accuracy. The best performing algorithm (75{\%} accuracy for rank 1) was the dot-product function that measures the cosine of the angle between spectra represented as vectors. Other methods in order of performance were the Euclidean distance (72{\%}), absolute value distance (68{\%}) PBM (65{\%}), and Hertz et al. (64{\%}). Intensity scaling and mass weighting were important in the optimized algorithms with the square root of the intensity scale nearly optimal and the square or cube the best mass weighting power. Several more complex schemes also were tested, but had little effect on the results. A modest improvement in the performance of the dot-product algorithm was made by adding a term that gave additional weight to relative peak intensities for spectra with many peaks in common.",

pages="6393--6400",
abstract="Electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography is a routine technique for identifying and quantifying compounds in complex mixtures. The identification step can be aided by matching acquired tandem mass spectra (MS2) against reference library spectra as is routine for electron ionization (EI) spectra from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). However, unlike the latter spectra, ESI MS2 spectra are likely to originate from various precursor ions for a given target molecule and may be acquired at varying energies and resolutions and have characteristic noise signatures, requiring processing methods very different from EI to obtain complete and high quality reference spectra for individual analytes. This paper presents procedures developed for creating a tandem mass spectral library that addresses these factors. Library building begins by acquiring MS2 spectra for all major MS1 peaks in an infusion run, followed by assigning MS2 spectra to clusters and creating a consensus spectrum for each. Intensity-based constraints for cluster membership were developed, as well as peak testing to recognize and eliminate suspect peaks and reduce noise. Consensus spectra were then examined by a human evaluator using a number of criteria, including a fraction of annotated peaks and consistency of spectra for a given ion at different energies. These methods have been developed and used to build a library from >9000 compounds, yielding 230,000 spectra.",

The first step before a structure can be elucidated is to determine its elemental composition. High-resolution mass spectrometry, which provides the exact mass, together with common constraint rules, for rejecting false proposed elemental compositions, cannot always provide one unique elemental composition solution.Results: The Multistage Elemental Formula (MEF) tool is presented in this article to enable the correct assignment of elemental composition to compounds, their fragment ions and neutral losses that originate from the molecular ion by using multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The method provided by MEF reduces the list of predicted elemental compositions for each ion by analyzing the elemental compositions of its parent (precursor ion) and descendants (fragments). MSn data of several metabolites were processed using the MEF tool to assign the correct elemental composition and validate the efficacy of the method. Especially, the link between the mass accuracy needed to generate one unique elemental composition and the topology of the MSn tree (the width and the depth of the tree) was addressed. This method makes an important step toward semi-automatic de novo identification of metabolites using MSn data.Availability: Software available at: http://abs.lacdr.gorlaeus.net/people/rojas-chertoContact:m.rojas@lacdr.leidenuniv.nl; t.reijmers@lacdr.leidenuniv.nlSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Here, we report a novel feature grouping method that  operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from MS data into spectra  without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon. We additionally  address a fundamental bottleneck in metabolomics, annotation of MS level signals, by  incorporating indiscriminant MS/MS (idMS/MS) data implicitly: feature detection is  performed on both MS and idMS/MS data, and feature-feature relationships are  determined simultaneously from the MS and idMS/MS data. This approach facilitates  identification of metabolites using in-source MS and/or idMS/MS spectra from a  single experiment, reduces quantitative analytical variation compared to  single-feature measures, and decreases false positive annotations of unpredictable  phenomenon as novel compounds.

The mass difference between the corresponding fragment ions present in the MS/MS spectra of the native and U-13C-labeled compound enabled the assignment of the number of carbon atoms to each fragment signal and allowed the generation of meaningful putative molecular formulas for each fragment ion, which in turn also helped determine the elemental composition of the precursor ion. Compared to laborious manual analysis of the MS/MS spectra, the presented algorithm marks an important step toward efficient fragment signal elucidation and structure annotation of metabolites in future untargeted metabolomics studies. Moreover, as demonstrated for a fungal culture sample, FragExtract also assists the characterization of unknown metabolites, which are not contained in databases, and thus exhibits a significant contribution to untargeted metabolomics research.",

abstract="Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC--ESI-MS) is a versatile and robust platform for metabolomic analysis. However, while ESI is a soft ionization technique, in-source phenomena including multimerization, nonproton cation adduction, and in-source fragmentation complicate interpretation of MS data. Here, we report chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior of 904 authentic standards collected under conditions identical to a typical nontargeted profiling experiment. The data illustrate that the often high level of complexity in MS spectra is likely to result in misinterpretation during the annotation phase of the experiment and a large overestimation of the number of compounds detected. However, our analysis of this MS spectral library data indicates that in-source phenomena are not random but depend at least in part on chemical structure. These nonrandom patterns enabled predictions to be made as to which in-source signals are likely to be observed for a given compound. Using the authentic standard spectra as a training set, we modeled the in-source phenomena for all compounds in the Human Metabolome Database to generate a theoretical in-source spectrum and retention time library. A novel spectral similarity matching platform was developed to facilitate efficient spectral searching for nontargeted profiling applications. Taken together, this collection of experimental spectral data, predictive modeling, and informatic tools enables more efficient, reliable, and transparent metabolite annotation.",

abstract="Improved analytical technologies and data extraction algorithms enable detection of >10 000 reproducible signals by liquid chromatography--high-resolution mass spectrometry, creating a bottleneck in chemical identification. In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. MS/MS evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using xMSannotator in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80{\%} of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the xMSannotator annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, xMSannotator, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as ChemSpider, KEGG, HMDB, T3DB, and LipidMaps.",

abstract="Metabolite identification is one of the biggest bottlenecks in metabolomics. Identifying human metabolites poses experimental, analytical, and computational challenges. Here we present a pipeline of previously developed cheminformatic tools and demonstrate how it facilitates metabolite identification using solely LC/MSn data. These tools process, annotate, and compare MSn data, and propose candidate structures for unknown metabolites either by identity assignment of identical mass spectral trees or by de novo identification using substructures of similar trees. The working and performance of this metabolite identification pipeline is demonstrated by applying it to LC/MSn data of urine samples. From human urine, 30 MSn trees of unknown metabolites were acquired, processed, and compared to a reference database containing MSn data of known metabolites. From these 30 unknowns, we could assign a putative identity for 10 unknowns by finding identical fragmentation trees. For 11 unknowns no similar fragmentation trees were found in the reference database. On the basis of elemental composition only, a large number of candidate structures/identities were possible, so these unknowns remained unidentified. The other 9 unknowns were also not found in the database, but metabolites with similar fragmentation trees were retrieved. Computer assisted structure elucidation was performed for these 9 unknowns: for 4 of them we could perform de novo identification and propose a limited number of candidate structures, and for the other 5 the structure generation process could not be constrained far enough to yield a small list of candidates. The novelty of this work is that it allows de novo identification of metabolites that are not present in a database by using MSn data and computational tools. We expect this pipeline to be the basis for the computer-assisted identification of new metabolites in future metabolomics studies, and foresee that further additions will allow the identification of even a larger fraction of the unknown metabolites.",

abstract="Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) is commonly used in high throughput metabolomics. One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures. This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call competitive fragmentation modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum). In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.",

abstract="Abstract Various classes of polypeptide antibiotics, including blocked linear peptides (gramicidin D), side-chain-cyclized peptides (bacitracin, viomycin, capreomycin), side-chain-cyclized depsipeptides (virginiamycin S), real cyclic peptides (tyrocidin, gramcidin S) and side-chain-cyclized lipopeptides (polymyxin B and E, amfomycin), were investigated by low-energy collision induced dissociation (LE-CID) as well as high-energy CID (HE-CID). Ion trap (IT) based instruments with different desorption/ionization techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (AP-MALDI) and vacuum MALDI (vMALDI) as well as a vMALDI-time-of-flight (TOF)/curved field-reflectron instrument fitted with a gas collision cell were used. For optimum comparability of data from different IT instruments, the CID conditions were standardized and only singly charged precursor ions were considered. Additionally, HE-CID data obtained from the TOF-based instrument were acquired and compared with LE-CID data from ITs. Major differences between trap-based and TOF-based CID data are that the latter data set lacks abundant additional loss of small neutrals (e.g. ammonia, water) but contains product ions down to the immonium-ion-type region, thereby allowing the detection of even single amino-acid (even unusual amino acids) substitutions. For several polypeptide antibiotics, mass spectrometric as well as tandem mass spectrometric data are shown and discussed for the first time, and some yet undescribed minor components are also reported. De novo sequencing of unusually linked minor components of (e.g. cyclic) polypeptides is practically impossible without knowledge of the exact structure and fragmentation behavior of the major components. Finally, the described standardized CID condition constitutes a basic prerequisite for creating a searchable, annotated MSn-database of bioactive compounds. The applied desorption/ionization techniques showed no significant influence on the type of product ions (neglecting relative abundances of product ions formed) observed, and therefore the type of analyzer connected with the CID process mainly determines the type of fragment ions.

Due to its sensitivity and widespread implementation, a favourite analytical method used in metabolomics is electrospray mass spectrometry. In this paper, we demonstrate our results in attempting to incorporate the potentials of multistage mass spectrometry into the metabolite identification routine. New software tools were developed and implemented which facilitate the analysis of multistage mass spectra and allow for efficient removal of spectral artefacts. The pre-processed fragmentation patterns are saved as fragmentation trees. Fragmentation trees are characteristic of molecular structure. We demonstrate the reproducibility and robustness of the acquisition of such trees on a model compound. The specificity of fragmentation trees allows for distinguishing structural isomers, as shown on a pair of isomeric prostaglandins. This approach to the analysis of the multistage mass spectral characterisation of compounds is an important step towards formulating a generic metabolite identification method.

This 4-year project is of particular relevance considering the multidisciplinary analytical chemistry and biology skills required to investigate the enormous complexity of contamination, effects, and cause-effect relationships. By integrating innovative mode-of-action-based biodiagnostic tools including in vitro and in vivo tests, transgenic organisms, and `omics' techniques with powerful fractionation and cutting edge, analytical, and computational structure elucidation tools, powerful new EDA approaches are being developed for the identification of toxicants in European surface and drinking waters. Innovative method development by young researchers at major European universities, research centers, and private companies has been closely interlinked with a joint European demonstration program, higher-tier EDA, and specialized training courses and secondments. Using a simplified protocol based on existing EDA tools, EDA-EMERGE fellows are also being trained to organize and run international and interdisciplinary sampling and monitoring campaigns within selected European river basin sites. Strong networking between academia, the private sector, and leading regulators in the field of river basin management and pollution management ensures the relevance of the research for practice and excellent employment opportunities for the fellows. Additionally, an internationally composed advisory board has been tasked to introduce new perspectives on monitoring, assessment, and management of emerging pollutants within and outside of Europe. The combination of cutting edge science with specialized training in complimentary soft skills is being offered with a strong emphasis on commercial exploitation and media competence which further enhances the employability of the fellows in research, academia, and beyond.",
