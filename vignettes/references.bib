	abstract = {Background: The Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) Metadata Framework is an established and widely used set of open-source community specifications and software tools for enabling discovery, exchange and publication of metadata from experiments in the life sciences. The original ISA software suite provided a set of user-facing Java tools for creating and manipulating the information structured in ISA-Tab - a now widely used tabular format. To make the ISA framework more accessible to machines and enable programmatic manipulation of experiment metadata, a JSON serialization ISA-JSON was developed. Results: In this work, we present the ISA API, a Python library for the creation, editing, parsing, and validating of ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON formats by using a common data model engineered as Python class objects. We describe the ISA API feature set, early adopters and its growing user community. Conclusions: The ISA API provides users with rich programmatic metadata handling functionality to support automation, a common interface and an interoperable medium between the two ISA formats, as well as with other life science data formats required for depositing data in public databases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Due to the complexity of metabolomics data, the variety of experimental designs, and the multiplicity of bioinformatics tools, providing experimenters with a simple and efficient resource to conduct comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their data is of utmost importance. In 2014, we launched the Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M; http://workflow4metabolomics.org) online infrastructure for metabolomics built on the Galaxy environment, which offers user-friendly features to build and run data analysis workflows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and annotation steps. Here we present the new W4M 3.0 release, which contains twice as many tools as the first version, and provides two features which are, to our knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major metabolomics technologies (i.e., LC–MS, FIA–MS, GC–MS, and NMR) can be analyzed on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for e-learning and training. The Workflow4Metabolomics 3.0 e-infrastructure thus not only offers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main metabolomics technologies, but it is also the first reference repository for metabolomics workflows."

	abstract = { Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2) is a widely used approach for structural annotation and identification of metabolites in complex biological samples. The importance of assessing the contribution of the precursor ion within an isolation window for MS2 experiments has been previously detailed in proteomics, where precursor ion purity influences the quality and accuracy of matching to mass spectral libraries, but to date, there has been little attention to this data-processing technique in metabolomics. Here, we present msPurity, a vendor-independent R package for liquid chromatography (LC) and direct infusion (DI) MS2 that calculates a simple metric to describe the contribution of the selected precursor. The precursor purity metric is calculated as “intensity of a selected precursor divided by the summed intensity of the isolation window”. The metric is interpolated at the recorded point of MS2 acquisition using bordering full-scan spectra. Isotopic peaks of the selected precursor can be removed, and low abundance peaks that are believed to have limited contribution to the resulting MS2 spectra are removed. Additionally, the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be taken into account. The package was applied to Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA)-based MS2 metabolomics data sets derived from three metabolomics data repositories. For the 10 LC-MS2 DDA data sets with > ±1 Da isolation windows, the median precursor purity score ranged from 0.67 to 0.96 (scale = 0 to +1). The R package was also used to assess precursor purity of theoretical isolation windows from LC-MS data sets of differing sample types. The theoretical isolation windows being the same width used for an anticipated DDA experiment (±0.5 Da). The most complex sample had a median precursor purity score of 0.46 for the 64,498 XCMS determined features, in comparison to the less spectrally complex sample that had a purity score of 0.66 for 5071 XCMS features. It has been previously reported in proteomics that a purity score of <0.5 can produce unreliable spectra matching results. With this assumption, we show that for complex samples there will be a large number of metabolites where traditional DDA approaches will struggle to provide reliable annotations or accurate matches to mass spectral libraries. }

abstract = {High accuracy, high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is becoming more common in analytical applications, yet databases of these spectra remain limited. Databases require good quality spectra with sufficient compound information, but processing, calibration, noise reduction and retrieval of compound information are time-consuming tasks that prevent many contributions. We present a comprehensive workflow for the automatic processing of MS/MS using formula annotation for recalibration and cleanup to generate high quality spectra of standard compounds for upload to MassBank (www.massbank.jp). Compound information is retrieved via Internet services. Reference standards of 70 pesticides were measured at various collision energies on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL to develop and evaluate the workflow. A total of 944 resulting spectra are now available on MassBank. Evidence of nitrogen adduct formation during MS/MS fragmentation processes was found, highlighting the benefits high accuracy MS/MS offers for spectral interpretation. A database of recalibrated, cleaned-up spectra resulted in the most correct spectra ranked in first place, regardless of whether the search spectra were recalibrated or not, whereas the average rank of the correct molecular formula was improved from 2.55 (uncalibrated) to 1.53 when using recalibrated MS/MS data. The workflow is available as an R package RMassBank capable of generating MassBank records from raw MS and MS/MS data and can be adjusted to process data acquired with different settings and instruments. This workflow is a vital step towards addressing the need for more high quality, high accuracy MS/MS spectra in spectral databases and provides important information for spectral interpretation.

		Numerous efforts have been undertaken to define such interactomes experimentally, for example yeast-tow-hybrid based protein-protein interaction networks or ChIP-seq based protein-DNA interactions for individual proteins.
			To complement these direct measurements, genome-scale quantitative multi-omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.)  enable researchers to predict novel functional interactions between molecular species.
			Moreover, these data allow to distinguish relevant functional from non-functional interactions in a specific biological context. 
			However, integration of multi-omics data is not straight forward due to their heterogeneity.
			So far, interaction networks have mostly been inferred from homogeneous functional data (e.g. gene co-expression networks) and novel methods are essential for inferring comprehensive regulatory networks across omics data types.

			Here we review state-of-the-art techniques for inferring the topology of interaction networks from functional multi-omics data, encompassing graphical models with multiple node types and quantitative-trait-loci (QTL) based approaches. 
			In addition, we will discuss Bayesian aspects of network inference, which allow for leveraging already established biological information, such as known protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, to guide the inference process.}

The BioUML vision is to provide a computational platform to build virtual cell, virtual physiological human and virtual patient. BioUML spans a comprehensive range of capabilities, including access to biological databases, powerful tools for systems biology (visual modelling, simulation, parameters fitting and analyses), a genome browser, scripting (R, JavaScript) and a workflow engine. Due to integration with the Galaxy platform and R/Bioconductor, BioUML provides powerful possibilities for the analyses of omics data. The plug-in-based architecture allows the user to add new functionalities using plug-ins. To facilitate a user focus on a particular task or database, we have developed several predefined perspectives that display only those web interface elements that are needed for a specific task. To support collaborative work on scientific projects, there is a central authentication and authorization system (https://bio-store.org). The diagram editor enables several remote users to simultaneously edit diagrams.}",

	abstract="Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible.",

However, descriptions of stem-like gene and pathway signatures in cancers are inconsistent across experimental systems. Driven by a need to improve our understanding of molecular processes that are common and unique across cancer stem cells (CSCs), we have developed the Stem Cell Discovery Engine (SCDE)—an online database of curated CSC experiments coupled to the Galaxy analytical framework. The SCDE allows users to consistently describe, share and compare CSC data at the gene and pathway level. Our initial focus has been on carefully curating tissue and cancer stem cell-related experiments from blood, intestine and brain to create a high quality resource containing 53 public studies and 1098 assays. The experimental information is captured and stored in the multi-omics Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA-Tab) format and can be queried in the data repository. A linked Galaxy framework provides a comprehensive, flexible environment populated with novel tools for gene list comparisons against molecular signatures in GeneSigDB and MSigDB, curated experiments in the SCDE and pathways in WikiPathways. The SCDE is available at http://discovery.hsci.harvard.edu.}",
