ENTRY       EC 2.3.2.14                 Enzyme
NAME        D-alanine gamma-glutamyltransferase
CLASS       Transferases;
            Acyltransferases;
            Aminoacyltransferases
SYSNAME     L-glutamine:D-alanine gamma-glutamyltransferase
REACTION    L-glutamine + D-alanine = NH3 + gamma-L-glutamyl-D-alanine [RN:R01149]
ALL_REAC    R01149
SUBSTRATE   L-glutamine [CPD:C00064];
            D-alanine [CPD:C00133]
PRODUCT     NH3 [CPD:C00014];
            gamma-L-glutamyl-D-alanine [CPD:C03738]
COMMENT     D-Phenylalanine and D-2-aminobutyrate can also act as acceptors, but more slowly. The enzyme also catalyses some of the reactions of EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-glutamyltransferase).
HISTORY     EC 2.3.2.14 created 1989
