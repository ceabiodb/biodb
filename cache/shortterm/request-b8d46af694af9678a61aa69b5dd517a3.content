     -!- The enzyme oxidizes a bound Mn(2+) ion to Mn(3+) in the presence of
         hydrogen peroxide.
     -!- The product, Mn(3+), is released from the active site in the presence
         of a chelator (mostly oxalate and malate) that stabilizes it against
         disproportionation to Mn(2+) and insoluble Mn(4+).
     -!- The complexed Mn(3+) ion can diffuse into the lignified cell wall,
         where it oxidizes phenolic components of lignin and other organic
         substrates.
     -!- It is inactive with veratryl alcohol or nonphenolic substrates.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.11.1.14">1.11.1.14</A>    Lignin peroxidase. 
(CC: -!- Involved in the oxidative breakdown of lignin by white-rot
         basidiomycete fungi.
     -!- The reaction involves an initial oxidation of the heme iron by
         hydrogen peroxide, forming compound I (Fe(IV)=O radical cation) at
         the active site.
     -!- A single one-electron reduction of compound I by an electron derived
         from a substrate molecule yields compound II (Fe(IV)=O non-radical
         cation), followed by a second one-electron transfer that returns the
         enzyme to the ferric oxidation state.
     -!- The electron transfer events convert the substrate molecule into a
         transient cation radical intermediate that fragments spontaneously.
     -!- The enzyme can act on a wide range of aromatic compounds, including
         methoxybenzenes and nonphenolic beta-O-4 linked arylglycerol beta-
         aryl ethers, but cannot act directly on the lignin molecule, which is
         too large to fit into the active site.
     -!- However larger lignin molecules can be degraded in the presence of
         veratryl alcohol.
     -!- It has been suggested that the free radical that is formed when the
         enzyme acts on veratryl alcohol can diffuse into the lignified cell
         wall, where it oxidizes lignin and other organic substrates.
     -!- In the presence of high concentration of hydrogen peroxide and lack
         of substrate, the enzyme forms a catalytically inactive form
         (compound III).
     -!- This form can be rescued by interaction with two molecules of the
         free radical products.
     -!- In the case of veratryl alcohol, such an interaction yields two
         molecules of veratryl aldehyde.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.11.1.15">1.11.1.15</A>    Peroxiredoxin. 
(CC: -!- Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant
         proteins.
     -!- They can be divided into three classes: typical 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys
         and 1-Cys peroxiredoxins.
     -!- The peroxidase reaction comprises two steps centered around a redox-
         active cysteine called the peroxidatic cysteine.
     -!- All three peroxiredoxin classes have the first step in common,
         in which the peroxidatic cysteine attacks the peroxide substrate and
         is oxidized to S-hydroxycysteine (a sulfenic acid).
     -!- The second step of the peroxidase reaction, the regeneration of
         cysteine from S-hydroxycysteine, distinguishes the three
         peroxiredoxin classes.
     -!- For typical 2-Cys Prxs, in the second step, the peroxidatic
         S-hydroxycysteine from one subunit is attacked by the 'resolving'
         cysteine located in the C-terminus of the second subunit, to form an
         intersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of several
         cell-specific thiol-containing reductants (R'-SH) (e.g. thioredoxin,
         AhpF, tryparedoxin or AhpD), completing the catalytic cycle.
     -!- In the atypical 2-Cys Prxs, both the peroxidatic cysteine and its
         resolving cysteine are in the same polypeptide, so their reaction
         forms an intrachain disulfide bond.
     -!- To recycle the disulfide, known atypical 2-Cys Prxs appear to use
         thioredoxin as an electron donor.
     -!- The 1-Cys Prxs conserve only the peroxidatic cysteine, so that its
         oxidized form is directly reduced to cysteine by the reductant
         molecule.)

     -!- While the substrate specificity of this enzyme is very similar to

         enzyme.

         species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence
         genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.
     -!- Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population
         density reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which,
         in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes.
     -!- N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-[acyl-carrier-protein] and hexanoyl-[acyl-carrier-
         protein] are the best substrates.

     -!- Unlike EC <A HREF= "/EC/2.3.2.26">2.3.2.26</A> the RING-E3 domain does not form a catalytic
         thioester intermediate with ubiquitin.
     -!- Many members of the RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase family are not

         are named CRL for Cullin-RING-Ligase).
     -!- In these complexes, the RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase provides

         complexes formed by certain RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase (see
         EC <A HREF= "/EC/2.3.2.27">2.3.2.27</A>), which include a neddylated cullin scaffold protein and
         a substrate recognition module.
     -!- The RING1 domain binds an EC <A HREF= "/EC/2.3.2.23">2.3.2.23</A>, and transfers the ubiquitin
         that is bound to it to an internal cysteine residue in the RING2
         domain, followed by the transfer of the ubiquitin from RING2 to the
         substrate.
     -!- Once the substrate has been ubiquitinated by the RBR-type ligase,
         it can be ubiqutylated further using ubiquitin carried directly on E2
         enzymes, in a reaction catalyzed by EC <A HREF= "/EC/2.3.2.27">2.3.2.27</A>.

     -!- Instead, they form a complex with a cullin scaffold protein and a
         substrate recognition module, which is named CRL for Cullin-RING-
         Ligase.
     -!- The cullin protein needs to be activated by the ubiquitin-like
         protein NEDD8 in a process known as neddylation.
     -!- The transfer of NEDD8 from a NEDD8-specific E2 enzyme onto the cullin
         protein is a secondary function of the RING-type E3 ubiquitin
         transferase in the CRL complex.

(CC: -!- The corrinoid adenosylation pathway comprises three steps: (i)
         reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) by a one-electron transfer.
     -!- This can occur non-enzymically in the presence of dihydroflavin
         nucleotides or reduced flavoproteins.
     -!- (ii) Co(II) is bound by corrinoid adenosyltransferase, resulting in
         displacement of the lower axial ligand by an aromatic residue.
     -!- The reduction potential of the 4-coordinate Co(II) intermediate is
         raised by ~250 mV compared with the free compound, bringing it to
         within physiological range.
     -!- This is followed by a second single-electron transfer from either
         free dihydroflavins or the reduced flavin cofactor of flavoproteins,
         resulting in reduction to Co(I).
     -!- (iii) the Co(I) conducts a nucleophilic attack on the adenosyl moiety
         of ATP, resulting in transfer of the deoxyadenosyl group and
         oxidation of the cobalt atom to Co(III) state.
     -!- Three types of corrinoid adenosyltransferases, not related by
         sequence, have been described.
     -!- In the anaerobic bacterium Salmonella enterica they are encoded by

         (involved in (S)-propane-1,2-diol utilization), and the eutT gene

     -!- The mammalian enzyme belongs to the PduO type.
     -!- The enzyme can act on other corrinoids, such as cob(II)inamide.)

     -!- It is a member of the 'AdoMet radical' (radical SAM) family,
         all members of which produce the 5'-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl radical and
         methionine from AdoMet (S-adenosylmethionine) by the addition of an
         electron from an iron-sulfur center.
     -!- The enzyme contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters.
     -!- The first cluster produces the radicals, which are converted into
         5'-deoxyadenosine when they abstract hydrogen atoms from C(6) and
         C(8), respectively, leaving reactive radicals at these positions that
         interact with sulfur atoms within the second (auxiliary) cluster.
     -!- Having donated two sulfur atoms, the auxiliary cluster is degraded
         during catalysis, but is regenerated immediately by the transfer of a
         new cluster from iron-sulfur cluster carrier proteins.
     -!- Lipoylation is essential for the function of several key enzymes

         genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.
     -!- Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population
         density reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which,
         in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes.
     -!- Plants or animals capable of degrading AHLs would have a therapeutic
         advantage in avoiding bacterial infection as they could prevent AHL-
         signaling and the expression of virulence genes in quorum-sensing
         bacteria.

(CC: -!- This enzyme, derived from the house dust mite, is a major component
         of the allergic immune response.
     -!- The substrate specificity of this enzyme is not altogether clear; it
         cleaves the low-affinity IgE receptor CD23 at 298-Glu-|-Ser-299 and
         155-Ser-|-Ser-156.
     -!- It also cleaves the pulmonary structural proteins occludin and
         claudin at Leu-|-Leu, Asp-|-Leu and at Gly-|-Thr bonds, and it can
         also cleave the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor
         (CD25).
     -!- Using a positional scanning combinatorial library, it was found that
         the major substrate-specificity determinant is for Ala in the P2
         position.
     -!- The enzyme shows only a slight preference for basic amino acids in
         the P1 and P3 positions and a preference for aliphatic amino acids

         proteolytic cleavage of a large precursor polyprotein, performed by a
         protease that is incorporated into the polyprotein.
     -!- Cleavage sites are apparently defined by features based on both
         sequence and structure since several sites in the polyprotein
         fulfilling the identified sequence requirements are not cleaved.
     -!- The presence of acidic (Asp), basic (Arg), aromatic (Tyr) or
         aliphatic (Leu) amino acids at the P1' position results in only minor
         differences in cleavage efficiency, suggesting that steric or
         conformational constraints may play a role in determining
         specificity.
