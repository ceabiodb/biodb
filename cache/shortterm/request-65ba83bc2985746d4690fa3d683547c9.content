     -!- While abscisic aldehyde is the best substrate, the enzyme also acts
         with indole-3-aldehyde, 1-naphthaldehyde and benzaldehyde as
         substrates, but more slowly.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.3.1.31">1.3.1.31</A>     2-enoate reductase.

<A HREF= "/EC/1.3.5.2">1.3.5.2</A>      Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone). 
(CC: -!- This Class 2 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase enzyme contains FMN.
     -!- The enzyme is found in eukaryotes in the mitochondrial membrane,
         in cyanobacteria, and in some Gram-negative and Gram-positive
         bacteria associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.
     -!- The reaction is the only redox reaction in the de-novo biosynthesis
         of pyrimidine nucleotides.
     -!- The best quinone electron acceptors for the enzyme from bovine liver
         are ubiquinone-6 and ubiquinone-7, although simple quinones, such as
         benzoquinone, can also act as acceptor at lower rates.
     -!- Methyl-, ethyl-, tert-butyl and benzyl-(S)-dihydroorotates are also
         substrates, but methyl esters of (S)-1-methyl and (S)-3-methyl and
         (S)-1,3-dimethyldihydroorotates are not.
     -!- Class 1 dihydroorotate dehydrogenases use either fumarate
         (EC <A HREF= "/EC/1.3.98.1">1.3.98.1</A>), NAD(+) (EC <A HREF= "/EC/1.3.1.14">1.3.1.14</A>) or NADP(+) (EC <A HREF= "/EC/1.3.1.15">1.3.1.15</A>) as

         orthoquinones 1,2-naphthoquinone and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone being
         the best substrates.
     -!- Dicoumarol (cf. EC <A HREF= "/EC/1.6.5.2">1.6.5.2</A>) and nitrofurantoin are competitive
         inhibitors with respect to the quinone substrate.
     -!- The semiquinone free-radical product may be non-enzymically reduced
         to the hydroquinone or oxidized back to quinone in the presence of
         O(2).
     -!- Abundant in the lens of the eye of some mammalian species.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.10.5.1">1.10.5.1</A>     Ribosyldihydronicotinamide dehydrogenase (quinone). 
(CC: -!- Unlike EC <A HREF= "/EC/1.6.5.2">1.6.5.2</A>, this quinone reductase cannot use NADH or NADPH;
         instead it uses N-ribosyl- and N-alkyldihydronicotinamides.
     -!- Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benz[a]anthracene, and the
         estrogens 17-beta-estradiol and diethylstilbestrol are potent
         inhibitors, but dicoumarol is only a very weak inhibitor.
     -!- This enzyme can catalyze both 2-electron and 4-electron reductions,
         but one-electron acceptors, such as potassium ferricyanide, cannot be
         reduced.
     -!- Formerly EC <A HREF= "/EC/1.10.99.2">1.10.99.2</A>.)

         latter is converted to prostaglandin F(2-alpha).
     -!- The enzyme also reduces tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene
         hydroperoxide and H(2)O(2), but not prostaglandin D(2) or

(CC: -!- Forms the first step in the acetylacetone degradation pathway of
         Acinetobacter johnsonii.
     -!- While acetylacetone is by far the best substrate, heptane-3,5-dione,
         octane-2,4-dione, 2-acetylcyclohexanone and ethyl acetoacetate can
         also act as substrates.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.13.12.24">1.13.12.24</A>   Calcium-regulated photoprotein. 
(CC: -!- Ca(2+)-regulated photoproteins are found in a variety of
         bioluminescent marine organisms, mostly coelenterates, and are
         responsible for their light emission.
     -!- The best studied enzyme is from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria.
     -!- The enzyme tightly binds the imidazolopyrazinone derivative
         coelenterazine, which is then peroxidized by oxygen.
     -!- The hydroperoxide is stably bound until three Ca(2+) ions bind to the
         protein, inducing a structural change that results in the formation
         of a 1,2-dioxetan-3-one ring, followed by decarboxylation and
         generation of a protein-bound coelenteramide in an excited state.
     -!- The calcium-bound protein-product complex is known as a blue
         fluorescent protein.
     -!- In vivo the energy is transferred to a green fluorescent protein
         (GFP) by Foerster resonance energy transfer.
     -!- In vitro, in the absence of GFP, coelenteramide emits a photon of
         blue light while returning to its ground state.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.13.99.3">1.13.99.3</A>    Tryptophan 2'-dioxygenase. 
(CC: -!- Acts on a number of indole-3-alkane derivatives, oxidizing the
         3-side-chain in the 2'-position.
     -!- Best substrates are L-tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.14.13.92">1.14.13.92</A>   Phenylacetone monooxygenase. 
(CC: -!- NADH cannot replace NADPH as coenzyme.
     -!- In addition to phenylacetone, which is the best substrate found to
         date, this Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase can oxidize other aromatic
         ketones (1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-2-one, 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-
         2-one and 3-phenylbutan-2-one), some alipatic ketones (e.g. dodecan-
         2-one) and sulfides (e.g. 1-methyl-4-(methylsulfanyl)benzene).)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.14.14.48">1.14.14.48</A>   Jasmonoyl-L-amino acid 12-hydroxylase. 
(CC: -!- The enzyme, found in plants, acts on jasmonoyl-L-amino conjugates,
         catalyzing the hydroxylation of the C-12 position of the jasmonic
         acid chain.
     -!- While the best studied substrate is (+)-7-epi-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine,
         the enzyme was shown to be active with jasmonoyl-L-valine and
         jasmonoyl-L-phenylalanine, and is likely to be active with other
         jasmonoyl-amino acid conjugates.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.14.14.49">1.14.14.49</A>   12-hydroxyjasmonoyl-L-amino acid 12-hydroxylase. 
(CC: -!- The enzyme, found in plants, acts on jasmonoyl-L-amino conjugates
         that have been hydroxylated at the C-12 position of the jasmonic acid
         chain by EC <A HREF= "/EC/1.14.14.48">1.14.14.48</A> further oxidizing that position to a
         carboxylate via an aldehyde intermediate.
     -!- While the best studied substrate is (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine,
         the enzyme was shown to be active with jasmonoyl-L-phenylalanine,
         and is likely to be active with other jasmonoyl-amino acid
         conjugates.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.14.17.3">1.14.17.3</A>    Peptidylglycine monooxygenase. 
(CC: -!- Peptidylglycines with a neutral amino acid residue in the penultimate
         position are the best substrates for the enzyme.
     -!- The product is unstable and dismutates to glyoxylate and the
         corresponding desglycine peptide amide, a reaction catalyzed by
         EC <A HREF= "/EC/4.3.2.5">4.3.2.5</A>.
     -!- Involved in the final step of biosynthesis of alpha-melanotropin and
         related biologically active peptides.)

<A HREF= "/EC/1.14.99.15">1.14.99.15</A>   4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (O-demethylating). 
(CC: -!- The bacterial enzyme consists of a ferredoxin-type protein and an
         iron-sulfur flavoprotein (FMN).
     -!- Also acts on 4-ethoxybenzoate, N-methyl-4-aminobenzoate and toluate.
     -!- The fungal enzyme acts best on veratrate.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.1.1.160">2.1.1.160</A>    Caffeine synthase. 
(CC: -!- Paraxanthine is the best substrate for this enzyme but the
         paraxanthine pathway is considered to be a minor pathway for caffeine
         biosynthesis.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.1.1.339">2.1.1.339</A>    Xanthohumol 4-O-methyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- The enzyme from hops (Humulus lupulus) has a broad substrate
         specificity.
     -!- The best substrates in vitro are resveratrol, desmethylxanthohumol,
         chalconaringenin and isoliquiritigenin.)

(CC: -!- Transfers saturated or unsaturated acyl residues of chain-length
         C(18) to C(20) to long-chain alcohols, forming waxes.
     -!- The best acceptor is cis-icos-11-en-1-ol.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.3.1.77">2.3.1.77</A>     Triacylglycerol--sterol O-acyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- Tripalmitoylglycerol can act as donor, and, more slowly, other
         triacylglycerols containing C(6) to C(22) fatty acids.
     -!- The best acceptors are 3-beta-hydroxysteroids with a planar ring
         system.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.3.1.121">2.3.1.121</A>    1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine O-acyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- Long-chain unsaturated acyl-CoAs are the best substrates.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.3.1.184">2.3.1.184</A>    Acyl-homoserine-lactone synthase. 
(CC: -!- Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial
         species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence
         genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.
     -!- Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population
         density reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which,
         in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes.
     -!- N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-[acyl-carrier-protein] and hexanoyl-[acyl-carrier-
         protein] are the best substrates.
     -!- The fatty-acyl substrate is derived from fatty-acid biosynthesis
         through acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] rather than from fatty-acid
         degradation through acyl-CoA.
     -!- S-adenosyl-L-methionine cannot be replaced by methionine,
         S-adenosylhomocysteine, homoserine or homoserine lactone.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.3.1.185">2.3.1.185</A>    Tropine acyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- Exhibits absolute specificity for the endo/3-alpha configuration
         found in tropine as pseudotropine (tropan-3-beta-ol; see
         EC <A HREF= "/EC/2.3.1.186">2.3.1.186</A>) is not a substrate.
     -!- Acts on a wide range of aliphatic acyl-CoA derivatives, with tigloyl-
         CoA and acetyl-CoA being the best substrates.
     -!- It is probably involved in the formation of the tropane alkaloid
         littorine, which is a precursor of hyoscyamine.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.3.1.232">2.3.1.232</A>    Methanol O-anthraniloyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- The enzyme from Concord grape (Vitis labrusca) is solely responsible
         for the production of O-methyl anthranilate, an important aroma and
         flavor compound in the grape.
     -!- The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and can use a range of
         alcohols with substantial activity, the best being butanol, benzyl
         alcohol, iso-pentanol, octanol and 2-propanol.
     -!- It can use benzoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA as acyl donors with lower
         efficiency.
     -!- In addition to O-methyl anthranilate, the enzyme might be responsible
         for the production of ethyl butanoate, methyl-3-hydroxy butanoate and
         ethyl-3-hydroxy butanoate, which are present in large quantities in
         the grapes.
     -!- Also catalyzes EC <A HREF= "/EC/2.3.1.196">2.3.1.196</A>.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.4.1.78">2.4.1.78</A>     Phosphopolyprenol glucosyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- Ficaprenyl phosphate is the best substrate; other polyprenols can
         also act as substrates, more slowly.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.4.1.136">2.4.1.136</A>    Gallate 1-beta-glucosyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- A number of substituted benzoic acids and, more slowly, cinnamic
         acids, can act as acceptors.
     -!- Vanillin is the best acceptor investigated.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.4.1.165">2.4.1.165</A>    N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide beta-1,4-N-
             acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. 
(CC: -!- Only substances containing sialic acid residues can act as acceptors;
         bovine fetuin is the best acceptor tested.)

(CC: -!- Isolated from strawberries (Fragaria X ananassa).
     -!- Acts best on phloroisovalerophenone and phlorobutyrophenone but will
         also glycosylate many other phenolic compounds.
     -!- A minor product of the reaction is the 5-O-beta-D-glucoside.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.6.1.21">2.6.1.21</A>     D-amino-acid transaminase. 
(CC: -!- The enzyme from thermophilic Bacillus species acts on many D-amino
         acids with D-alanine and D-2-aminobutyrate as the best amino donors.
     -!- It can similarly use any of several 2-oxo acids as amino acceptor,
         with 2-oxoglutarate and 2-oxobutyrate among the best.
     -!- The enzyme from some other sources has a broader specificity.
     -!- Formerly EC <A HREF= "/EC/2.6.1.10">2.6.1.10</A>.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.6.1.84">2.6.1.84</A>     Arginine--pyruvate transaminase. 
(CC: -!- While L-arginine is the best substrate, the enzyme exhibits broad
         substrate specificity, with L-lysine, L-methionine, L-leucine,
         L-ornithine and L-glutamine also able to act as substrates, but more
         slowly.
     -!- Pyruvate cannot be replaced by 2-oxoglutarate as amino-group
         acceptor.
     -!- This is the first catalytic enzyme of the arginine transaminase
         pathway for L-arginine utilization in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
     -!- This pathway is only used when the major route of arginine
         catabolism, i.e. the arginine succinyltransferase pathway,
         is blocked.)

<A HREF= "/EC/2.7.1.62">2.7.1.62</A>     Phosphoramidate--hexose phosphotransferase. 
(CC: -!- Activity is observed with several hexoses; of these glucose is the
         best substrate and the product from it is alpha-D-glucose
         1-phosphate.
     -!- The phosphoramidate donor can be replaced by N-phosphoglycine and by
         an N-phosphohistidine.
     -!- May be identical with EC <A HREF= "/EC/3.1.3.9">3.1.3.9</A>.)

<A HREF= "/EC/3.1.1.2">3.1.1.2</A>      Arylesterase. 
(CC: -!- Acts on many phenolic esters.
     -!- It is likely that the three forms of human paraoxonase are lactonases
         rather than aromatic esterases.
     -!- The natural substrates of the paraoxonases are lactones, with (+-)-5-
         hydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z,4Z-eicostetraenoic-acid 1,5-lactone being the best

         is relatively specific for removal of N-acetylalanine from peptides.
     -!- Display dipeptidyl-peptidase activity on glycyl-peptides, perhaps as
         a result of misrecognition of the glycyl residue as an uncharged

         N-butylformamide, N-allylformamide, N-(2-(cyclohex-1-
         enyl)ethyl)formamide and N-(1-phenylethyl)formamide, but much more
         slowly.
     -!- Amides of other acids do not act as substrates.)

<A HREF= "/EC/3.6.1.45">3.6.1.45</A>     UDP-sugar diphosphatase.

(CC: -!- Degrades a variety of glycosaminoglycans of the chondroitin-sulfate-
         and dermatan-sulfate type.
     -!- Chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan and dermatan
         sulfate are the best substrates but the enzyme can also act on
         hyaluronan at a much lower rate.
     -!- Keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate and heparin are not substrates.
     -!- In general, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) chains
         comprise a linkage region, a chain cap and a repeat region.
     -!- The repeat region of CS is a repeating disaccharide of glucuronic
         acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) [-4)GlcA(beta-1-
         3)GalNAc(beta-1-](n), which may be O-sulfated on the C-4 and/or C-6
         of GalNAc and C-2 of GlcA.

     -!- Both the concentrations and locations of sulfate-ester substituents
         vary with glucosaminoglycan source.
     -!- The related enzyme EC <A HREF= "/EC/4.2.2.21">4.2.2.21</A> has the same substrate specificity but
         removes disaccharide residues from the non-reducing ends of both

(CC: -!- Degrades a variety of glycosaminoglycans of the chondroitin-sulfate-
         and dermatan-sulfate type.
     -!- Chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan and dermatan
         sulfate are the best substrates but the enzyme can also act on
         hyaluronan at a much lower rate.
     -!- The related enzyme EC <A HREF= "/EC/4.2.2.20">4.2.2.20</A> has the same substrate specificity but
         produces a mixture of oligosaccharides of different sizes that are
         ultimately degraded to tetra- and disaccharides.
     -!- Both enzymes act by the removal of a relatively acidic C-5 proton of
         the uronic acid followed by the elimination of a 4-linked hexosamine,
         resulting in the formation of an unsaturated C4-C5 bond on the
         hexuronic acid moiety of the products.
     -!- Formerly EC <A HREF= "/EC/4.2.2.4">4.2.2.4</A> and EC <A HREF= "/EC/4.2.99.6">4.2.99.6</A>.)

<A HREF= "/EC/4.6.1.15">4.6.1.15</A>     FAD-AMP lyase (cyclizing). 
(CC: -!- While FAD was the best substrate tested the enzyme also splits
         ribonucleoside diphosphate-X compounds in which X is an acyclic or
         cyclic monosaccharide or derivative bearing an X-OH group that is
         able to attack internally the proximal phosphorus with the geometry
         necessary to form a P=X product; either a five-atom monocyclic
         phosphodiester or a cis-bicyclic phosphodiester-pyranose fusion.
     -!- The reaction is strongly inhibited by ADP or ATP but is unaffected by
         the presence of the product, cFMN.)

(CC: -!- Acts on dicarboxylic acids of chain length C(5) to C(16); the best
         substrate is dodecanedioic acid.)

<A HREF= "/EC/7.5.2.6">7.5.2.6</A>      ABC-type lipid A-core oligosaccharide transporter. 
(CC: -!- An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type transporter, characterized by the
         presence of two similar ATP-binding domains/proteins and two integral
         membrane domains/proteins.
     -!- The enzyme, best characterized from the bacterium Escherichia coli,
         is located in the inner membrane and mediates the movement of lipid A
         attached to the core oligosaccharide from the cytoplasm to the
         periplasmic side of the inner membrane, an important step in the
         lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway.
     -!- Not to be confused with EC <A HREF= "/EC/7.5.2.5">7.5.2.5</A>, which is implicated in the
         translocation of LPS from the inner membrane to the outer membrane
         and acts later in the process.)
