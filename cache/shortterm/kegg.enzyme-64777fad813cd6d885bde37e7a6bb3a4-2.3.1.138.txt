            Transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups
SYSNAME     caffeoyl-CoA:putrescine N-(3,4-dihydroxycinnamoyl)transferase
REACTION    caffeoyl-CoA + putrescine = CoA + N-caffeoylputrescine [RN:R01944]
ALL_REAC    R01944
SUBSTRATE   caffeoyl-CoA [CPD:C00323];
            putrescine [CPD:C00134]
