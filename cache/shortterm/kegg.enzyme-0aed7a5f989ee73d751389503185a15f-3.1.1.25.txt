ENTRY       EC 3.1.1.25                 Enzyme
NAME        1,4-lactonase;
            gamma-lactonase
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on ester bonds;
            Carboxylic-ester hydrolases
SYSNAME     1,4-lactone hydroxyacylhydrolase
REACTION    a 1,4-lactone + H2O = a 4-hydroxyacid [RN:R03708]
ALL_REAC    R03708 > R02933 R03034
SUBSTRATE   1,4-lactone [CPD:C01770];
            H2O [CPD:C00001]
PRODUCT     4-hydroxyacid [CPD:C01991]
COMMENT     The enzyme is specific for 1,4-lactones with 4-8 carbon atoms. It does not hydrolyse simple aliphatic esters, acetylcholine, sugar lactones or substituted aliphatic lactones, e.g. 3-hydroxy-4-butyrolactone; requires Ca2+.
