ENTRY       EC 1.3.99.14                Enzyme
NAME        cyclohexanone dehydrogenase;
            cyclohexanone:(acceptor) 2-oxidoreductase
CLASS       Oxidoreductases;
            Acting on the CH-CH group of donors;
            With unknown physiological acceptors
SYSNAME     cyclohexanone:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase
REACTION    cyclohexanone + acceptor = cyclohex-2-enone + reduced acceptor [RN:R02234]
ALL_REAC    R02234
SUBSTRATE   cyclohexanone [CPD:C00414];
            acceptor [CPD:C00028]
PRODUCT     cyclohex-2-enone [CPD:C02395];
            reduced acceptor [CPD:C00030]
COMMENT     2,6-Dichloroindophenol can act as acceptor. The corresponding ketones of cyclopentane and cycloheptane cannot act as donors.
