  cache.directory:
    title: Path to the cache folder.
    type: character
    description: The directory in which cache files are stored. The default location depends on your operating system and the choice between the custom persistent cache and the Bioconductor persistent cache.
    default: NULL

  cache.read.only:
    title: Set cache system in read only mode.
    type: logical
    description: If set to TRUE, then the cache system becomes not writable. This is mainly used for test purposes.
    default: FALSE

  cache.subfolders:
    title: Use subfolders to divide files into cache folder.
    type: logical
    description: Use subfolders shortterm and longterm in cache system, in order to divide the downloaded files. If a whole database is downloaded, the file(s) will be put in the longterm subfolders.
    deprecated: Short and long term folders are not used anymore. Now one subfolder is automatically created for each database connector.
    default: TRUE

  cache.system:
    title: Enable cache system.
    type: logical
    description: Cache system is ON.
    default: TRUE

  use.cache.for.local.db:
    title: Enable the use of the cache system also for local databases.
    type: logical
    description: |-

    description: If the field of an entry is accessed but has no value, then biodb will try to compute one. This is done by following rules that tell biodb in which database to look for this field's value.
    default: TRUE

  factory.cache:
    title: Enable factory cache.
    type: logical
    description: Set the factory cache system ON. The factory cache system stores entry instances already created. When the factory cache is enabled and an entry already created is requested, the factory returns that same instance. This is possible, because biodb uses the RefClass OOP system, which uses references instead of object copy. Thus, if you modify an entry and ask the factory for the same entry, it will be the same exact object that will be given to you and it will include your modifications. On the contrary, if the factory cache is OFF, a new entry instance will be returned to you each time. The factory cache enables to speed up entry retrieval when the same entries are requested several times, avoiding the parsing process.
    default: FALSE
    deprecated: The cache is now always enabled. Thus all entries returned are referenced inside the cache and will be returned when needed.
